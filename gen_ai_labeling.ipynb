      "Alright, let's tackle this tweet analysis step by step. The user wants me to determine the primary emotion conveyed in the tweet using one of the specified labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll read the tweet carefully: \"Love that Jurgen just told the boys to smile and play. Amazing managing in a tough situation. #BAR #Championsleague #Liverpool.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "The key words here are \"love,\" \"amazing,\" and the overall tone seems positive. The author is expressing admiration for Jurgen's actions, which suggests joy or possibly surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the context provided, it's about the UEFA Champions League, a prestigious football competition. Jurgen likely refers to Jurgen Klopp, the manager of Liverpool FC. The tweet praises his leadership during a tough match, using words like \"love\" and \"amazing,\" which are strong positive indicators.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, mapping this to the guidelines: joy is associated with serenity or ecstasy, while surprise relates to distraction or amazement. In this case, the author isn't just surprised; they're expressing admiration and positivity about Jurgen's management. So, it leans more towards joy rather than surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there's any nuance I'm missing. The mention of a tough situation could imply some difficulty, but the overall sentiment is clearly positive. There's no indication of fear or anger; instead, it's all praise and appreciation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the emotion here is best classified as joy.\n",
      "</think>\n",

      "Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The tweet is talking about some amazing books and mentions \"reading pleasures\" which sounds positive. They also mention influencers, which could imply inspiration or influence leading to joy. There's no negative language here; it's all about enjoyment and appreciation of books. So I think the emotion here is joy.\n",

      "Okay, I need to determine the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is expressing frustration that media attention has moved on after 24 hours, but they're reminding others about the significance of the event. They mention it's an 800-year-old building and a beacon of hope that burned down.\n",
      "\n",
      "The emotions here seem to be a mix of sadness and maybe some anger. The user is upset that people have moved on quickly, which could indicate frustration or anger. However, the main focus is on the loss of something historically and emotionally significant, which points more towards sadness. They're expressing grief over the destruction of a cherished landmark.\n",
      "\n",

      "Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet is from Greta Thunberg, who's known for her climate activism and Fridays for Future movement. The text says: \"Educating for Extinction. (climate change as a catalyst for shifts in a failing system)\" with several hashtags related to climate issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll break down the content. The phrase \"Educating for Extinction\" sounds pretty intense. It suggests that current educational practices might be leading towards extinction, possibly implying that things are getting worse or that there's a lack of effective action. The mention of climate change as a catalyst for shifts in a failing system adds to the sense that the systems in place aren't handling the situation well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the emotions associated with each label: anger is about annoyance or rage; disgust is more about dislike or disinterest; fear involves apprehension or anxiety; joy is serenity or ecstasy; sadness is pensiveness or grief; surprise is distraction or amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at Greta's message, she's highlighting a critical issue—climate change—and the failure of systems to address it. This seems more like frustration rather than pure anger. But according to the guidelines, if it's similar to annoyance or rage, we classify it as anger. Alternatively, maybe it's sadness because she's pointing out a failing system that could lead to extinction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but \"Educating for Extinction\" sounds more like a critique of current practices leading to negative outcomes, which might be frustration or anger. However, the overall tone doesn't seem to express pure anger; instead, it's more about highlighting a problem and its severity, which could lean towards sadness because it's a serious issue causing concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider the context of her activism. Greta often speaks out against systemic failures, which can evoke feelings of frustration or anger. However, in this tweet, she's more focused on the educational aspect and how it relates to climate change. It might be more about sadness because she's pointing out that education isn't addressing the real issues, leading to potential extinction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe it's fear because talking about shifts in a failing system could imply anxiety about the future. But I think the primary emotion here is more about the gravity of the situation and the failure of systems, which might lean towards sadness or perhaps anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the tweet isn't explicitly expressing an emotion; it's more of a statement. According to the guidelines, if there's no expressed emotion, we still have to choose one from the list. So maybe I should look for implied emotions. The hashtags include #ExtinctionRebellion and #climatestrike, which are terms associated with activism driven by concern and urgency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering all this, I think the primary emotion here is sadness because it's about a failing system leading towards extinction, which is a heavy and somber topic.\n",

      "First, let's break down what's being expressed here. The user is talking about hoping that Mohamed Salah, a footballer, will score three goals (a hat trick) in the next match of the Champions League. They're using several hashtags related to the competition and specific teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "The emotion here seems positive because they're expressing a desire for something good to happen—specifically, their favorite player or team succeeding. When someone hopes for success or achievement, it usually indicates joy or excitement. \n",

      "I don't think it's anger because there's no indication of frustration or rage. Disgust doesn't seem right either since that's more about dislike. Fear is about being scared, and surprise is about something unexpected without negative connotations. So, sadness makes the most sense here.\n",

      "The tweet also mentions that a part of history, art, architecture, and religion has been damaged, which indicates a deep concern about the loss. However, the primary emotion isn't sadness for themselves but rather irritation directed at others not sharing their sentiment. So while there's an element of sadness about the event itself, the main emotion conveyed is more about the frustration with others' reactions.\n",

      "I should consider if any other emotions fit better.

      "First, let's understand the context. The Notre Dame Cathedral fire happened on April 15, 2019, which was a significant event that caused a lot of damage and emotional response globally. People were devastated because it's such an iconic and culturally important building.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, looking at the tweet itself: the user is thanking someone for a $5 million donation to rebuild the cathedral. The mention of the hashtag \"#NotreDameCathedralFire\" ties it directly to that event. \n",
      "\n",
      "The emotion here seems positive because they're expressing gratitude for a substantial contribution towards rebuilding something important. Gratitude often falls under joy or happiness, but I need to check the mapping guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the guidelines, if the emotion is similar to serenity or ecstasy, classify as joy. In this case, the tweet isn't overly ecstatic, but it's definitely a positive sentiment—expressing thanks and support for rebuilding efforts. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or sadness here; instead, it's about appreciation and hope for restoration.\n",

Pollinators are important for ecosystems, so sharing good news about them could indicate happiness or excitement.\n",

      "However, the tweet also includes the hashtag #NotreDameCathedralFire. This refers to the tragic event where the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris caught fire on April 15, 2019. That was a significant and saddening event for many people around the world. So why is this hashtag included here?\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the structure of the tweet, it's combining two unrelated topics: pollinators (which are positive) and the Notre-Dame fire (a negative event). The user might be trying to contrast good news with a tragedy or perhaps using the hashtags for some other reason, like trending topics.\n",
      "\n",
      "But focusing on the emotion conveyed, the primary part of the tweet is about \"good news,\" which suggests joy. The mention of the cathedral fire doesn't seem to add an emotional layer here; it's more of a contextual tag.

      "\n",
      "First, let's break down the words used. She uses \"damned\" which is a strong word, often expressing frustration or anger. The phrase \"strikes again\" could imply that global warming is causing repeated problems, which might be frustrating or upsetting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greta Thunberg is known for her activism regarding climate change, so this tweet is likely about the ongoing issues with global warming. The use of \"damned\" suggests she's expressing negative feelings towards it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Since she's using strong language and talking about a recurring problem, I think it's more about frustration or anger rather than something like fear or sadness.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I'll read the tweet carefully: \"Anyone noticed the faceless man or I'm wrong !! #GameOfThrones\". The user is asking if others have noticed something specific in Game of Thrones—specifically mentioning the \"faceless man.\" They're using an exclamation mark and a hashtag, which might indicate excitement or urgency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The context given mentions that Game of Thrones was a popular series with its last season premiering in April 2019. The tweet seems to be about a particular element from the show, possibly related to a spoiler or a theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, analyzing the emotion: The use of \"!!\" suggests emphasis and excitement. They're eager to know others' thoughts on this point. This could indicate curiosity or enthusiasm rather than negative emotions like anger or sadness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the mapping guidelines, surprise is associated with distraction or amazement. While the tweet isn't explicitly expressing shock, the excitement and eagerness might lean towards surprise because they're highlighting something unexpected or intriguing about the show.\n",

      "I should also consider if there's any indication of other emotions. There's no clear sign of anger (annoyance), disgust (dislike), fear (apprehension), joy (serenity), or sadness (pensiveness).

      "\n",
      "First, the phrase \"Useful Idiots\" is a term that's often used to describe people who are manipulated into supporting something harmful without realizing it. Using this term here suggests frustration or annoyance towards those individuals. The word \"colluded\" implies collaboration with something negative—Socialist Tyranny in this case. So, the author is expressing disapproval and maybe anger towards these people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hashtag #Venezuela adds context about the ongoing political crisis there. Given that Venezuela has been in a state of tension regarding its leadership since 2019, the tweet likely reflects the author's stance on the situation. The tone here isn't positive; it's more critical and derogatory towards those supporting or involved with what the author perceives as tyranny.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: if the emotion is similar to annoyance or rage, classify it as anger. Here, \"Useful Idiots\" definitely carries a negative connotation, showing irritation or frustration towards certain individuals. There's no indication of fear, joy, sadness, disgust (as in dislike), or surprise. The primary emotion seems to be anger directed at those seen as idiots for supporting socialist tyranny.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, looking at the language used: \"you bitch\" is clearly an insult, which indicates anger or frustration. The phrase \"Not my daughter\" suggests someone is trying to protect their child, which could be out of fear or concern, but combined with the insult, it leans more towards anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second part says, \"A mother can be a fighter too moly proved it.\" There's a typo here, probably meant to say \"moly\" as \"my\" or maybe another word. Regardless, the sentiment is about being strong and protective, which again ties into feelings of anger when someone feels they need to defend their child.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hashtags are related to World Book Day and Harry Potter, but those don't add much in terms of emotion—they're just topics. The overall tone from the tweet seems confrontational and aggressive, so I'm leaning towards anger as the primary emotion.\n",

      "The word \"excited\" directly relates to joy because excitement is a positive emotion that brings happiness. The use of \"OMG\" also adds to the sense of enthusiasm and eagerness, which are indicators of joy. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or fear here.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should consider if there's any possibility it could be surprise.

Simply child abuse.\" The hashtags are #GretaThunberg and #Climatechange, but the main content is about the Thunbergs being a bad family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Breaking it down: The tweet starts with \"The Thunberg's are the epitome of the disastrous modern family.\" Using words like \"disastrous\" and \"epitome\" suggests strong negative feelings. Then it lists specific parenting styles and disorders, which are all negative terms. Ending with \"Simply child abuse\" is a harsh accusation.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what emotion does this convey? The language is very critical and uses strong terms to describe the family negatively. It's not just mild criticism; it's more like intense dislike or condemnation. Looking at the mapping guidelines: if the tweet conveys secondary emotions similar to disinterest, dislike, or loathing, we classify it as disgust.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think it's anger because while there's criticism, it's more about expressing distaste rather than rage. Fear doesn't fit here; there's no sense of worry or anxiety. Sadness isn't the primary emotion either—it's more about disapproval. Surprise is out of the question since nothing unexpected is mentioned.\n",

      "Next, they thank various groups like readers, writers, etc., using a lot of exclamation marks and warm language. This reinforces the idea that they're feeling happy and appreciative.

      "First, looking at the content, the user expresses a strong desire for change. They're frustrated with the current situation and feel that drastic measures might be necessary, even though they don't support violence. This frustration could stem from various reasons like the political instability, economic issues, or human rights concerns in Venezuela.\n",
      "\n",
      "The emotion here isn't just mild dissatisfaction; it's more intense. The user is advocating for the removal of a leader, which suggests a deeper issue with the current state of affairs. They might be feeling anger because they see Maduro as a problem that needs to be addressed, even if through non-violent means.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should consider other emotions too. Is there any sign of disgust? Maybe towards Maduro's policies or actions, but the primary emotion seems more about frustration and desire for change. Fear could be involved if they're worried about the future, but the main sentiment appears to be a call to action against the current leader.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joy isn't present here; it's more about negative feelings. Sadness might come into play with the country's situation, but again, the primary emotion is frustration and anger towards Maduro's continued leadership.\n",

Doom and gloom usually refer to negative or depressing messages, so the user is comparing Greta Thunberg's message to something more uplifting.\n",

      "First, I'll read the tweet carefully: \"Suarez is one horrible fucker isn't he. #ChampionsLeague #BARLIV\". The mention of Suarez and calling him a \"horrible fucker\" clearly indicates strong negative emotions. \n",

      "I need to decide whether this falls under anger or disgust. The term \"horrible fucker\" leans more towards expressing anger rather than mere disgust. It's a direct insult with a tone of frustration.\n",

      "First, I notice the use of \"beautiful\" which is a positive word. The author is talking about a Sunday evening in a positive light. They also mention \"kick fascism butts,\" which seems like they're taking action against something negative—fascism. But the way it's phrased with \"butts\" and the emoji might be playful or sarcastic, not necessarily angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The emojis used are a purple heart 💜, which often symbolizes love, solidarity, or support. The hashtags include election-related ones like #SpainElection and #EleccionesGenerales28A, as well as #FelizDomingo, which means \"Happy Sunday\" in Spanish. These suggest the author is involved in or supportive of the election process.\n",

The tweet ends with \"RIP House Mormont\" and includes several hashtags related to Game of Thrones and its characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tone here seems somber and reflective. The deaths described are significant, especially since they're about characters who were loyal and died in service. Words like \"loyal,\" \"died protecting,\" and \"RIP\" all carry a sense of loss and sorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the mapping guidelines, sadness is associated with emotions like pensiveness or grief. Since the tweet is expressing a deep sense of loss and mourning for these characters, it fits under sadness rather than other categories like anger or fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there's any hint of another emotion, but the overall sentiment leans heavily towards sadness without any clear signs of joy, surprise, or other emotions.

      "First, let's break down the content. They're talking about Liverpool's performance, specifically their touch in the final third of the field. The phrase \"poor at best\" suggests that they think Liverpool isn't performing well there. \n",

      "The first part says it's \"all well and good to have all the ball,\" which is a bit confusing.

So overall, the sentiment seems negative towards Liverpool's play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet isn't expressing any positive emotions like joy or serenity. It's more about criticism of performance, which could be seen as frustration or disappointment. \n",

      "Frustration can sometimes fall under anger because it's a form of irritation or annoyance. So in this case, the primary emotion is likely anger because they're expressing dissatisfaction with Liverpool's play.\n",

      "I don't think it's disgust because that usually relates to something being repulsive, which isn't the case here. Fear would involve anxiety about future events, but the tweet is about current performance.

      "First, let me break down the components. The phrase \"Here’s to\" is often used as a toast or an expression of praise. \"Badass bitches\" definitely has a positive connotation here; it's a compliment highlighting strength and coolness. The mention of Westeros refers to the setting of Game of Thrones, which is known for its complex characters and epic battles.\n",

      "Now, considering the emotions: \"badass bitches\" suggests admiration and respect for strong female characters. The tone is celebratory and appreciative. There's no indication of any negative feelings like anger or disgust. It doesn't seem fearful because it's talking about a fictional battle that's probably been resolved by now. Joy seems likely because the user is praising something they care about, but let me think deeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tweet isn't expressing pure joy; it's more about acknowledging and celebrating strong characters. However, in the context of the mapping guidelines, if the emotion is similar to serenity or ecstasy, it would be joy.

      "The phrase \"throw your favourite books\" might seem playful at first glance, but when combined with \"at people you hate,\" it takes on a different tone.

      "I'm thinking about the emotions listed: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. This doesn't seem like joy because throwing books at people you hate isn't a happy action.

      "\n",
      "The tweet is a notification about her language style. It might be seen as a heads-up or a disclaimer. Since she's addressing minors and informing them of her language use, perhaps this could be interpreted as a form of warning, which might relate to fear? Or maybe it's more about being cautious, which could tie into fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if the primary emotion is simply informative without any strong emotion, but I have to choose from the given options. Maybe the closest would be surprise because she's alerting them in a way that might catch attention, similar to surprising someone with information.\n",

      "But wait, another angle: using potty language for punctuation could imply frustration with how serious the climate situation is, which might tie into anger. But the tweet itself isn't expressing anger; it's more of an announcement about her communication style.\n",

      "I'm a bit torn between surprise and maybe fear. However, since she's informing them without showing any negative emotion towards them, perhaps surprise isn't the best fit.

      "Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet and classify it into one of the given categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me start by reading the tweet carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tweet says: \"Excellent speech from Clive Lewis MP. Every MP should have been present at this debate. A Climate Emergency must be declared. #ExtinctionRebellion #GretaThunberg #LabourGreenRebellion https://t.co/MTz1xVGpAR\"\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the author is praising Clive Lewis MP's speech by calling it \"Excellent.\" That word has a positive connotation, suggesting approval or satisfaction. They also mention that every MP should have been present at the debate, which implies they're disappointed or upset that not everyone attended. However, disappointment might lean towards sadness or anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, they state that a Climate Emergency must be declared. This is a strong statement indicating urgency and concern about climate issues. The hashtags used are #ExtinctionRebellion, which I know is associated with environmental activism, often linked to Greta Thunberg's movement. The other hashtag is #LabourGreenRebellion, suggesting political engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: If the tweet conveys a secondary emotion similar to pensiveness or grief, it should be classified as sadness. Here, the author seems concerned about the climate situation and perhaps frustrated that more MPs didn't attend the debate. However, their main expression is approval of the speech and advocacy for action.\n",
      "\n",
      "The word \"excellent\" clearly shows positive sentiment, which aligns with joy or maybe surprise if something unexpectedly good happened. But in this context, it's more about agreement and support rather than a surprising event. The call to declare a Climate Emergency adds urgency but doesn't necessarily convey fear or anger; instead, it's a call to action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the options, \"excellent\" suggests joy because they're expressing satisfaction with the speech. There's no indication of surprise, as there's nothing unexpected mentioned. Disappointment about MP attendance could hint at sadness, but the overall tone is more positive and supportive.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it all together, the primary emotion here seems to be joy because of the praise for the speech and the support for climate action.\n",

      "Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the primary emotion conveyed. The user is asking who's coming out for the Barcelona vs Liverpool game. They mention having free pool and tunes on the jukebox, suggesting a fun environment where people can enjoy football, have drinks, and listen to music. The emoji used is a smiley face with raised eyebrows, which typically indicates happiness or excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The context provided mentions that the UEFA Champions League is a prestigious competition determining the best European team. This adds significance to the game being discussed. The tweet seems to be inviting others to join in on the fun, indicating enthusiasm about the event.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: joy is associated with serenity or ecstasy. While the user isn't expressing extreme excitement, their positive tone and smiley emoji suggest a happy and enjoyable mood. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or sadness. The focus is on gathering friends for a good time, which aligns with joy.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, let's break down the words used here. \"Delightful\" and \"deliciously\" are positive adjectives, which immediately make me think of joy or happiness. The word \"drubbing\" usually refers to a severe beating or defeat, but in this context, it seems like the person is talking about a football match where one team won convincingly. So, \"delightful drubbing\" suggests that the speaker is happy about the victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hashtags also give some context: #ChampionsLeague, which is a competition where teams compete to be the best in Europe. The tone here seems celebratory, using words like \"delightful\" and \"deserved,\" indicating satisfaction with the outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the mapping guidelines, joy is associated with emotions like serenity or ecstasy. While \"delightful\" isn't exactly ecstasy, it's a positive emotion that fits under joy. There's no indication of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise here. The speaker seems pleased and happy about the result.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, looking at the language used: they called someone an asshole, which is a strong insult. The use of multiple exclamation marks shows that they're really upset or angry. Words like \"asshole\" are definitely negative and convey frustration or rage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hashtags mentioned are related to football clubs, but the main content is about calling someone a name. So the emotion here isn't about the competition itself but about their personal feelings towards another user. The tone is clearly aggressive and filled with anger.\n",

      "I don't see any signs of disgust, like describing something as恶心 (disgusting). There's no fear or anxiety mentioned. The tweet doesn't express joy or happiness; instead, it's full of irritation and rage. Sadness or pensiveness isn't present either. Surprise would be if they were amazed by something unexpected, but this is more about frustration.\n",

      "First, looking at the language used: \"That's what I hear!\" seems excited or enthusiastic. They're encouraging others to pick up books and are offering suggestions. The use of emojis like the book might indicate positivity. The tone doesn't show any negative emotions; instead, it's more about sharing and excitement.\n",

      "The context given mentions that there's been a crisis in Venezuela regarding who is the legitimate president since January 10th, 2019.

      "\n",
      "First, let me break down the words. \"I want you to panic!\" That's a strong statement. Panic implies fear or urgency. So she's directly telling people to feel panic, which is a strong emotion. The use of exclamation marks also adds intensity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the context, Greta Thunberg is known for being very vocal about climate change and often uses strong language to convey the urgency of the situation. Her message here seems to be pushing for action by instilling fear or anxiety about the current state of the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Which one fits best? The tweet is asking people to panic, which relates to fear.

      "The context is tense because it's about who should lead the country, so emotions are likely running high.

      "Hmm, let's break it down. The tweet starts with a rhetorical question: \"#CrownOfThorns of Christ?......Are you kidding me?\" That sounds like surprise or maybe confusion. Then they express doubt about the longevity of thorns lasting 3000 years, which could be skepticism. But then they add \"just curious,\" so it's more about seeking information rather than anger or disgust.\n",

      "I don't think it's fear because there's no indication of anxiety or terror. It's not sadness either; they're not expressing grief. Disgust doesn't fit here since there's no dislike involved. Anger is more about annoyance, which isn't present. Joy? Not really, as the situation is serious.\n",

      "The phrase \"yeah nah\" is slang for agreeing in a way that shows doubt or playfulness, often used humorously.

      "I'm not exactly sure what #Luxy refers to here. Maybe it's a typo or another hashtag? But regardless, the main point seems to be about coping with the pain of the event. The emojis used are a church symbol ( Episcopal?), a heart, and a couple emoji. So maybe they're trying to express something positive or comforting in response to the tragedy.\n",

      "So considering the emotions: the primary emotion here isn't sadness because they're talking about lowering the pain, which implies moving past it.

      "Now, considering the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The user is expressing their favorite moment, which was Sam running away. The emoji used is a laughing one, indicating humor. So, the primary emotion here seems to be joy because they're highlighting a moment that made them happy or amused.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think it's anger because there's no indication of frustration or rage. Disgust doesn't fit either since there's nothing negative about the action described.

That's a strong statement, expressing approval or admiration. They follow it with \"Righto!!\" which sounds like an enthusiastic agreement or confirmation. Then there's a raised eyebrow emoji 🙄, which can indicate various things depending on context—maybe skepticism, surprise, or even playful teasing.\n",

      "Now, considering the emotion mapping guidelines: I need to classify this into anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The tweet seems positive because they're praising their league as the best. The use of \"Righto!!\" is exclamatory and enthusiastic, which leans towards joy.

      "\n",
      "The user starts with \"USER USER USER\" which seems like they're addressing someone or maybe emphasizing their message. Then they say, \"Give them a date & time, I'm certain volunteers would be swarming to help sweep & clean up at #NotreDameCathedralFire to lift the hearts of our Brothers and Sisters in Paris.\" They end with \"That's how we roll! #MormonHelpingHands\" and a link.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tone here is positive. The user is suggesting organizing volunteers to help after the fire, aiming to uplift people in Paris. Words like \"swarming,\" \"help,\" \"sweep & clean up,\" \"lift the hearts,\" and \"That's how we roll!\" all have a hopeful and proactive vibe. They're offering support and showing solidarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the emotion categories: anger is about annoyance or rage, which isn't here. Disgust is more about dislike, not applicable. Fear would involve anxiety or terror, but the tweet is about helping, so that's not it. Joy is about serenity or ecstasy—maybe, but let me think deeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user is expressing willingness to help and a positive outlook, which could be seen as joy because they're focused on making a positive impact and showing support. Alternatively, it might also touch on surprise if the situation is unexpected, but I think the primary emotion here is more about positivity and hope.\n",

      "Hmm, the tweet starts with a hashtag about the climate crisis, which immediately makes me think of concern or worry.

      "\n",
      "Next, she writes, \"I hope we’re not too late to undo what we’ve done.\" This line expresses a sense of urgency and worry about the possibility that it might be too late to fix the damage caused by climate change. The words \"too late\" suggest fear or anxiety because if they're too late, there could be severe consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the hashtags she used: #GretaThunberg is her own movement, so that's just a tag. #Takeaction and #Actionworks seem to encourage others to join in, which shows she's proactive but also concerned about the situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the overall tone seems worried and anxious about the climate crisis. She's not expressing anger or sadness directly; instead, her focus is on the urgency of taking action before it's too late. This aligns with fear because fear often involves a sense of impending danger or worry about future events.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think she's feeling joyful here because there's no positive language. Disgust doesn't seem right either since she's not expressing dislike but rather concern. Surprise isn't applicable because there's nothing unexpected in the message. Sadness could be a possibility, but her emphasis is more on the urgency and potential negative outcomes rather than personal grief.\n",

      "Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user mentions World Heritage Day and reflects on their nation's vibrant history. They compare it to the swift action taken after the Notre Dame fire and suggest rethinking heritage preservation.\n",

      "Hmm, the tweet seems positive because they're highlighting their national heritage and suggesting proactive steps. Words like \"vibrant\" and \"rich\" are uplifting. The mention of taking swift action implies a sense of urgency but in a constructive way. They're not expressing any negative emotions; instead, they're encouraging others to take positive actions.\n",

      "\n",
      "The main emotion here seems to be happiness or joy because they're congratulating someone and expressing gladness about an achievement. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or sadness. The use of \"Congrats\" and \"Glad\" clearly shows a positive sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think it's surprise because there's nothing unexpected mentioned, just a celebration of Messi's milestone. It's not fear or disgust either; those would involve more negative language. Sadness isn't present since the tweet is about a positive achievement.\n",

      "\n",
      "The tweet starts with calling a coalition of violent ideologies from certain parties like AfD and UKIP as white supremacists and human supremacists attacking Greta Thunberg. The author uses words like \"vile\" which definitely has negative connotations. They also mention science denial being linked to carnism, anthropocentrism, speciesism, and racism.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the main points are criticizing these groups for their ideologies and their attack on Greta. The language is strong and condemnatory. Words like \"vile,\" \"science denial,\" and the hashtags about supremacisms all indicate a negative sentiment.\n",

      "I need to map this to one of the six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let's think about each:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Anger: This is when someone is annoyed or enraged. The tweet seems more than just annoyed; it's a strong condemnation.\n",
      "- Disgust: This involves disliking something or feeling it's repulsive. The author clearly dislikes the ideologies and actions of these groups, so this could fit.\n",
      "- Fear: Not really present here; there's no indication of fear.\n",
      "- Joy: Definitely not, as the tone is negative.\n",
      "- Sadness: There's some negativity, but more about disapproval rather than sadness.\n",
      "- Surprise: No element of surprise in the tweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between anger and disgust. The tweet isn't just angry; it's expressing a deep dislike for these groups' actions and ideologies. \"Vile\" suggests a strong sense of disgust. So I think disgust is the primary emotion here because it's about disliking something morally.\n",

      "The user expresses sympathy and哀悼 (sadness) towards Paris because of the fire. They're not angry or fearful; it's more about feeling bad for the people affected. There's no indication of surprise or joy—just a clear expression of sorrow.\n",
