4. Joy 

The author expresses enthusiasm for Arya and a celebratory tone, but then adds "#NotToday" which suggests that they are actually being ironic or sarcastic about the Game of Thrones series in general, implying disappointment or frustration with the show's ending (presumably Season 8). However, based on the text alone, the primary emotion conveyed is joy.
