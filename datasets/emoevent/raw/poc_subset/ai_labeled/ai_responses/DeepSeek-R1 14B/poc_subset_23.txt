Alright, let's see. I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion the author intended to convey. The options are Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, or Surprise.

Looking at the tweet: "The Left: Burn! Burn you symbol of Christian crusaders and colonialism! Burn! Burn! Burn! Also the Left: How dare you insinuate this heinous crime could have been perpetrated by a particular group of people, you fucking bigot!!! #NotreDameCathedralFire #NotreDame"

First, I notice the repeated use of "Burn!" which is strong language indicating frustration or anger. The author is addressing "The Left," suggesting they might be part of a group that's being criticized.

Next, the tweet attacks Notre-Dame Cathedral as a symbol of Christian crusaders and colonialism. This shows contempt towards the institution, which aligns with Disgust but also has an element of Anger because of the inflammatory language.

Then, the author contradicts themselves by saying "How dare you insinuate..." implying that someone else is trying to blame a particular group for the fire. The use of strong words like "heinous crime" and calling someone a bigot adds more anger.

The hashtags are #NotreDameCathedralFire and #NotreDame, which relate to the event but don't add emotional context beyond what's already in the tweet.

Considering all this, while there's some Disgust towards the cathedral as a symbol, the predominant emotion seems to be Anger because of the strong language and the confrontational tone directed at "The Left."

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion based on the given list. Let me read it again. The tweet says: "The Left: Burn! Burn you symbol of Christian crusaders and colonialism! Burn! Burn! Burn! Also the Left: How dare you insinuate this heinous crime could have been perpetrated by a particular group of people, you fucking bigot!!! #NotreDameCathedralFire #NotreDame"

Hmm. The author is talking about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire and seems to be addressing "The Left." They are using strong language like "Burn!" repeated multiple times, which suggests anger or frustration. Then they criticize others for insinuating that a particular group might have been responsible for the fire, calling them a bigot with vulgar language.

Breaking it down: The first part is advocating for burning a symbol related to Christian crusaders and colonialism, which indicates strong negative feelings towards these symbols. The second part expresses outrage at someone implying blame on a specific group, using words like "heinous crime" and "fucking bigot." This shows both anger and perhaps disgust or surprise.

Looking at the emotion list: Anger is definitely present because of the strong language and criticism. Disgust might be there too, but the primary emotion seems to be anger directed at The Left for their stance on symbols and blame. Fear isn't really here; it's more about reacting to an event. Sadness doesn't seem to fit as this is more about frustration. Surprise? Not exactly, because the tweet is responding to the situation rather than being surprised by it.

So I think the main emotion conveyed is Anger.

The emotion conveyed in the tweet is primarily **Anger** due to the strong language and criticism directed towards The Left regarding their stance on symbols and blame related to the Notre Dame Cathedral fire.

Okay, so I need to classify the emotion in this tweet regarding the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The options are Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, or Surprise.

First, let's read the tweet carefully: "The Left: Burn! Burn you symbol of Christian crusaders and colonialism! Burn! Burn! Burn! Also the Left: How dare you insinuate this heinous crime could have been perpetrated by a particular group of people, you fucking bigot!!! #NotreDameCathedralFire #NotreDame"

Breaking it down, the author is talking about The Left expressing strong emotions. They're using exclamation marks and strong language like "Burn!" multiple times, which indicates intense feelings.

The first part says, "Burn! Burn you symbol of Christian crusaders and colonialism!" This seems to express anger towards the cathedral as a symbol of what they consider problematicâ€”Christian crusaders and colonialism. The repeated use of "Burn" suggests frustration or rage.

In the second part, they say, "How dare you insinuate this heinous crime could have been perpetrated by a particular group of people, you fucking bigot!!!" Here, the author is calling someone a bigot and using harsh language. This again shows anger towards those who might blame a specific group for the fire.

Putting it together, both parts of the tweet display strong negative emotions directed at The Left's perspective on the cathedral fire. The use of explicit language like "fucking bigot" clearly conveys anger. There's no indication of fear, surprise, or sadness; instead, it's more about the author's irritation and frustration with The Left's stance.

So, considering all this, the emotion here is Anger.
</think>

The emotion conveyed in the tweet is primarily Anger. The use of strong language and exclamation marks indicates frustration and intense feelings directed towards The Left's perspective on the Notre Dame Cathedral fire.

**Answer: 1. Anger**
