Alright, let's try to figure out what emotion is behind this tweet. The user wrote, "FH underway... Hope's to USER #Liverpool to win #BARLIV #Ucl #SSFootball #ChampionsLeague #TeamKenya #TheScoreKE https://t.co/1YigWZ3vxH". 

First, I notice that the user is talking about a football match involving Liverpool. The mention of "Hope's to USER #Liverpool to win" suggests they're rooting for Liverpool to succeed in this game. They also used hashtags like #Ucl (UEFA Champions League), which indicates it's an important competition.

The emotion here seems positive because they express hope for Liverpool winning. There's no indication of any negative feelings like anger or disgust. It doesn't sound fearful either; instead, it's more about supporting their team and hoping for a good outcome.

I should consider the options given: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise. Since they're expressing hope and support, that aligns with joy or serenity. There's no surprise here because they're stating their desire rather than reacting to an unexpected event.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed is likely Joy.
