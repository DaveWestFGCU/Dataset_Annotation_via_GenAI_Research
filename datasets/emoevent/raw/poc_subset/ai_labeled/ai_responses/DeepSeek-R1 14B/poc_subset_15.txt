Alright, let's see. I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion it conveys. The options are Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, or Surprise.

First, looking at the content of the tweet: "FREEDOM for the People of Venezuela ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡ª We are with you!!! #VenezuelaLibre #Venezuela https://t.co/4FCNaPzoOj". It's all about supporting freedom for Venezuelans. The user is expressing solidarity and support, using exclamation marks which show enthusiasm.

The hashtags used are positive: VenezuelaLibre suggests a desire for liberty and democracy. The emojis also reinforce this positive sentimentâ€”likely showing support or hope.

The author is clearly on the side of Juan Guaido, given the context provided earlier about the crisis regarding legitimacy between Maduro and Guaido. The tone here is supportive and encouraging, aimed at rallying people behind the cause.

So, considering the emotions: There's no anger or frustration expressed; it's more about solidarity and hope. It doesn't express disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise. Instead, it radiates positivity and support, which falls under Joy.
