Okay, so I have this tweet to classify into one of six emotions: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, or Surprise. The tweet says, "Nobody can make you feel inferior without your permission. Don't let them. HAPPY NEW MONTH! #ezplaza #wednesdaythoughts #ecommerce #esupermarket #ChampionsLeague https://t.co/mVqjuriA3D"

First, I'll break down the content. The first part is a motivational statement about not letting others make you feel inferior. It's positive and empowering. Then it switches to celebrating a new month with "HAPPY NEW MONTH!" which clearly indicates joy.

Looking at the hashtags: #ezplaza might be a business or event, #wednesdaythoughts suggests a reflective or inspirational post, #ecommerce and #esupermarket are related to business topics. The mention of #ChampionsLeague adds context about sports but doesn't directly affect the emotion.

The overall tone seems uplifting and positive. Words like "HAPPY" are strong indicators of joy. There's no sign of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise. It's more about encouragement and positivity towards the future.

Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion behind this tweet. The user is saying "Nobody can make you feel inferior without your permission. Don't let them." That sounds positive and motivational. Then they add "HAPPY NEW MONTH!" which clearly expresses joy or happiness. There are also some hashtags like #ChampionsLeague, which might relate to sports enthusiasm but doesn't affect the emotion here.

Looking at the options: 1 is Anger, not applicable here. 2 is Disgust, nope. 3 is Fear, doesn't fit. 4 is Joy, which seems right because of "HAPPY NEW MONTH!". 5 is Sadness, no. 6 is Surprise, but there's nothing surprising in the tweet.

So the emotion conveyed is definitely Joy.

The author intended to convey **Joy** with their tweet, as they expressed positivity and happiness about the new month.
