Okay, I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion it conveys. Let's look at the tweet closely.

The user is talking about billionaires pledging money to fix a church, specifically Notre-Dame Cathedral after the fire. They mention that while these donations are happening, they could instead donate to "things" that truly matter. The use of quotation marks around "things" might indicate some sarcasm or implication that the church isn't as important as other causes.

The hashtags #NotreDameCathedralFire and #NotreDame suggest awareness of the event but the tone seems critical. The author is pointing out a contrast between what they consider trivial (donating to a church) versus more significant issues. This implies frustration or disapproval.

Looking at the emotion options, I have to choose between Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, and Surprise. The tweet isn't expressing fear, joy, surprise, or sadness directly. It's more about criticism of priorities, which aligns with disgust because it's a strong negative feeling towards the action being discussed.

So, the emotion conveyed here is likely Disgust.

Alright, so I need to classify the emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the tweet is talking about billionaires pledging a lot of money to fix a church. The author seems upset that these same people could donate funds to "things that truly matter" instead. There's an implication here that the church isn't as important as other causes.

The tone feels critical and disappointed. Words like "pledging tons of money" and the contrast with "things that truly matter" show frustration. The use of quotation marks around "things" might indicate sarcasm, suggesting the author doesn't value the church's repair over other issues.

Looking at the emotion options: Anger is about annoyance or rage. Disgust is more about dislike or disinterest. Fear isn't really here. Joy and Surprise are obviously not fitting. Sadness could be a contender because it's about grief, but the tweet isn't sad; it's more about frustration with priorities.

So, the main emotion seems to be Anger because of the criticism directed at the billionaires' priorities.

Okay, I need to figure out the emotion behind this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The tweet says: "Billionaires pledging tons of money to fix a church whilst they can easily donate funds to “things” that truly matter. #NotreDameCathedralFire #NotreDame https://t.co/JCgtECYWJQ"

So, the author is talking about billionaires donating money to repair a church, specifically Notre Dame after it caught fire. They're pointing out that these same people could donate to things that truly matter. The tone here seems critical or disappointed.

Looking at the emotion list: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise.

I think the author is expressing frustration or disappointment because they believe the money should go elsewhere instead of just a church. That makes me lean towards Anger because it's about being annoyed or upset with the situation.

Alternatively, maybe it's Disgust if they're expressing disapproval or dislike towards the billionaires' priorities. But I think Anger is more fitting here because it's about being annoyed that funds aren't going to more important things.

Wait, but could it be Sadness? The fire itself is a sad event, but the tweet isn't focused on the tragedy directly; instead, it's about the response to it. So maybe not Sadness.

I think Anger fits better because of the criticism directed at the billionaires' actions.
