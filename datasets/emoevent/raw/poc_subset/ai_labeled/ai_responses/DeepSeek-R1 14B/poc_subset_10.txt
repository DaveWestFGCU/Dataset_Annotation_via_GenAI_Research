Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what emotion this tweet conveys. Let me read it again: "Greta Thunberg: The hero we need, or the result of crack-pot parenting? #gretathunberg #extinctionrebellion #environment #instapodcast https://t.co/xDAKVkc40N". Hmm.

First, I notice that Greta Thunberg is referred to as "The hero we need." That sounds positive and赞赏. The use of "hero" suggests admiration or respect. But then there's a contrast with "or the result of crack-pot parenting?" Crack-pot means someone who's considered crazy or irrational, so implying her parents might be seen that way could be negative.

So the tweet seems to present two perspectives: one praising Greta as a hero and another questioning her upbringing in a critical way. The author is presenting both views but it's unclear which they personally feel more strongly about.

Looking at the options, I need to choose the emotion intended from these six: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise. 

If the tweet is highlighting Greta as a hero, that could be associated with Joy or admiration. However, the mention of crack-pot parenting adds a sarcastic or critical tone, which might lean towards Disgust because it's questioning her legitimacy or upbringing in a negative way.

Alternatively, maybe the author is trying to provoke thought by presenting both sides, but without more context, I think the primary emotion is either admiration (Joy) or criticism (Disgust). Since the second part seems like a jab at her parents, it might be Disgust. But wait, "crack-pot parenting" could also be seen as an attempt to undermine her credibility, which would fit more under Disgust.

I'm not entirely sure, but I think the author is expressing some level of criticism or doubt towards Greta's status as a hero by questioning her parents' influence. So that might point towards Disgust, as it's a form of dislike or disapproval.

The emotion conveyed in the tweet is primarily **Disgust**, as the author questions Greta Thunberg's legitimacy and upbringing in a critical manner.

**Answer:** 2. Disgust

Okay, I need to classify this tweet's emotion. The user provided a list: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise.

The tweet is about Greta Thunberg, calling her a "hero" or the result of "crack-pot parenting." Let me break it down.

First, "hero we need" suggests admiration or support. That's positive, leaning towards Joy or maybe even something else. But then there's a contrast: she's either a hero or comes from bad parenting. The second part seems to question her legitimacy or the influence of her upbringing. This could imply doubt or skepticism.

Now, looking at the emotion labels:

1. Anger – Not obvious here; no direct signs of anger.
2. Disgust – Maybe if the author is criticizing her, but the language isn't harsh.
3. Fear – Doesn't seem to fit; no indication of fear.
4. Joy – The tweet starts positively, but ends with a question mark, which complicates it.
5. Sadness – Not really present here.
6. Surprise – Could be if the author is reacting to something unexpected about her.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The mention of "crack-pot parenting" could be sarcastic or dismissive. It might show Disgust towards how she's portrayed or her background, suggesting dislike for the narrative around her.

Alternatively, the question format could indicate curiosity (Surprise) but more likely, if there's a negative undertone about her origins, it's Disgust.

Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion behind it. The user is talking about Greta Thunberg, referring to her as "The hero we need" which clearly shows admiration and respect. On the other hand, they also mention "the result of crack-pot parenting?" That part seems sarcastic or critical, questioning her upbringing.

So, there's a mix here—praise for being a hero but skepticism about her background. The overall tone isn't overtly positive or negative. It leans towards admiration but with a hint of doubt or irony. Since the options given are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise, I need to pick the one that fits best.

Admiration might relate to joy, but there's also some questioning, which could imply surprise. However, the main emotion seems to be admiration, which is more aligned with joy. But since the user is presenting a balanced view, maybe it's not purely joy. Alternatively, the sarcastic part might hint at disgust, but I don't think that's the primary feeling.

Considering all this, the tweet primarily conveys admiration and respect towards Greta Thunberg. So, the emotion here is joy.
