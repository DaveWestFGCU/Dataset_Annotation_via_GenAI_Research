Okay, so I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion the author intended. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Looking at the tweet: "Happy World Book Day #WorldBookDay 🎶Nwanne Wa USER On #FLORIDE ✌️💃🕺 with USER 💅X USER 👟". 

First, I notice the word "Happy" right there. That's a strong indicator of joy. The emojis also seem positive—like the dancing and celebration emojis. They're using a lot of party-related symbols which adds to that happy vibe.

There are mentions of users, but it doesn't seem like any negative words are being used towards them. Instead, it looks like they're celebrating or having fun with others. The hashtags like #CelebrityTwosday also suggest some kind of event or gathering, which is usually a positive and joyful occasion.

I don't see anything that points to anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise. It's all about being happy and celebrating World Book Day along with some activities. So, the emotion here must be joy.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion it conveys. The options are Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, or Surprise. Let me look at the tweet closely.

The tweet says: "Happy World Book Day #WorldBookDay 🎶Nwanne Wa USER On #FLORIDE ✌️💃🕴️#CelebrityTwosday with USER 💅X USER 👟"

First, I notice the word "Happy" right at the beginning. That's a strong indicator of Joy. The use of emojis like dancing and celebration symbols also supports that feeling.

The hashtags are related to World Book Day and some other events, but they don't seem negative or neutral. Instead, they're part of celebrating something. There's no indication of any negative emotions here.

Looking at the structure, it starts with a positive statement and uses emojis that are generally associated with happiness and celebration. The mention of users might be for tagging others to join in the celebration, which again is a Joyful action.

I don't see any words or emojis that would suggest other emotions like Anger (there's no frustration or rage), Disgust (no dislike or loathing), Fear (nothing scary or anxious), Sadness (no grief or pensiveness), or Surprise (no amazement or distraction). It's all upbeat and celebratory.

So, putting it together, the author is clearly expressing Joy on World Book Day.
