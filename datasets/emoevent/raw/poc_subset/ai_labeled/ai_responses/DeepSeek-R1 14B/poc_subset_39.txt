Okay, I need to classify the emotion in this tweet about Venezuela. Let me read it carefully.

The user says, "What is happening now in #Venezuela is unacceptable! The #Elite of this world is killing the country (US embargo is active now) and will come as the saviors as soon as Mauduro will be down because he doesn't want to play their game!"

First, the word "unacceptable" shows strong negative feelings. They're clearly upset about what's happening. The mention of the elite killing the country using the US embargo suggests frustration or anger towards external forces.

The tone is critical and accusatory. Words like "killing the country" and "saviors" imply a sense of betrayal or manipulation, which adds to the emotional intensity.

I don't see elements of fear, joy, surprise, disgust, or sadness dominating here. The primary emotion seems to be anger because of the strong language and the direct criticism towards both Maduro and the international elite.

Alright, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to classify a tweet based on the emotion it conveys, choosing from six categories: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, or Surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says, "What is happening now in #Venezuela is unacceptable! The #Elite of this world is killing the country (US embargo is active now) and will come as the saviors as soon as Maduro will be down because he doesn't want to play their game!"

Breaking it down: The author starts by expressing strong disapproval with "unacceptable." They're upset about what's happening in Venezuela. Then they accuse the elite of killing the country, blaming both the US embargo and Maduro for not playing along. Words like "killing" and "saviors" suggest frustration and anger.

Looking at the emotion list: Anger includes annoyance and rage. The tweet definitely has elements of frustration andегодування (anger). There's no clear sign of disgust or dislike towards a person, more so towards the situation and those causing it. Fear isn't evident; there's no indication of anxiety or terror. Joy and surprise are out of the question here.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed is Anger.

Okay, I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion it conveys. Let me read through it again.

The tweet says: "What is happening now in #Venezuela is unacceptable! The #Elite of this world is killing the country (US embargo is active now) and will come as the saviors as soon as Mauduro will be down because he doesn't want to play their game!"

First, I notice the exclamation mark right after "unacceptable!" which suggests strong emotion. Words like "killing the country" are quite intense. The author is expressing frustration or anger towards the situation in Venezuela and blames an elite group for causing harm.

They mention the US embargo as part of the problem and suggest that other countries will act as saviors once Maduro is gone, implying a conspiracy or dissatisfaction with his leadership. The use of words like "unacceptable" and "killing" indicates a strong negative emotion, likely anger.

I don't see elements of fear or surprise here; it's more about expressing disapproval and frustration towards the actions affecting Venezuela.
