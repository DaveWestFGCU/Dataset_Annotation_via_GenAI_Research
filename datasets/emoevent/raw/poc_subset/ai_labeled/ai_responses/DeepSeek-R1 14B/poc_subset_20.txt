Okay, I need to classify the emotion in this tweet. The user is talking about a new translation project and says they're "so excited!" That's pretty clear excitement, which falls under Joy. Even though it's a positive environmental topic related to Greta Thunberg, the key emotion here is excitement.

Alright, I need to classify this tweet's emotion based on the given options. Let me read it again.

The tweet says: "New translation project! So excited! #scenerurhjärtat #gretathunberg #svantethunberg #malenaernman #beataernman #polaris https://t.co/mWjslBmm6J"

First, the user mentions a new translation project and expresses excitement. The word "excited" clearly indicates a positive emotion. Now, looking at the options: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise.

Joy includes serenity, ecstasy, etc., so excitement fits under Joy. There's no indication of any negative emotions here; it's all about being thrilled about a new project. The hashtags are related to environmental figures but don't affect the emotion conveyed in this tweet. So, the most relevant label is Joy.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion based on the given options: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise. The tweet is about a new translation project and expresses excitement. Let me break it down.

First, the tweet starts with "New translation project! So excited!" That exclamation of excitement immediately tells me the author is feeling positive. Excited usually falls under Joy because it's a strong positive emotion.

Looking at the hashtags: #scenerurhjärtat, which I think translates to "heartbeat" or something exciting in Swedish. Then there are mentions of Greta Thunberg, her family members, and Polarisk. These seem related to their climate movement but also adding context about what the project might be about.

The link probably leads to more information about the translation project, maybe a new book or resource from these activists. The enthusiasm in "so excited" is clearly Joy because it's expressing happiness and eagerness.

I don't see any signs of Anger, Disgust, Fear, Sadness, or Surprise here. It's all positive and cheerful.
