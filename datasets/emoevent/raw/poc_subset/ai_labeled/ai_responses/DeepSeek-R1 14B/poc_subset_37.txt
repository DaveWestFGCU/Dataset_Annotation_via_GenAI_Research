Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion is being conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says: "I actually cried at the end, you all thought a male would be the hero but no Arya to the rescue! My hero ðŸ¤© #GameofThrones #BattleForWinterfell #Arya #AryaStark #MaisieWilliams". 

First, I'll break it down. The user mentions crying, which immediately makes me think of sadness or maybe even joy because sometimes people cry out of happiness too. But in this context, since they're talking about a TV show ending, crying is likely due to the emotional impact of the story.

The tweet talks about Arya being the hero instead of a male character that others expected. The user seems proud and surprised by this outcome. They use emojis like ðŸ¤© which are often associated with excitement or amazement. So there's definitely an element of surprise here because Arya wasn't the expected hero, and that twist probably caught many people off guard.

The hashtags also include #AryaStark and #MaisieWilliams, who plays her. This suggests a strong positive feeling towards her character. The user refers to Arya as "my hero," which shows admiration and support, indicating a positive emotion beyond just surprise or sadness.

Putting it all together: the user experienced an emotional moment (crying), was surprised by the outcome (Arya being the hero instead of a male), and expresses pride and joy in her accomplishment. So, while there's some sadness from crying, the primary emotion seems to be joy because they're expressing happiness about Arya's victory.

I should also consider if there are other emotions like fear or anger, but those don't seem present here. The tweet isn't expressing any of those feelings. It's more about celebrating an unexpected and positive outcome for a character they love.

Okay, I need to classify this tweet into one of the given emotions. Let's read it carefully.

The user says they "actually cried" at the end. Crying often relates to sadness or maybe joy? But in this context, since it's about a TV show ending, probably more towards sadness because crying can be due to emotional impact, possibly from something sad happening.

Next, the tweet mentions that people thought a male would be the hero, but Arya came to the rescue. The user expresses excitement with "My hero ðŸ¤©" and uses emojis like ðŸ¤© which usually signify surprise or amazement.

So there's both a sad element (crying) and a surprising/joyful element (Arya being the hero). But the main emotion intended might be joy because of the positive reaction to Arya, especially using "My hero" and the emoji. Alternatively, it could be surprise because the outcome wasn't expected.

Wait, but the user cried, which is more associated with sadness or maybe even awe (which is a mix). However, the overall tone seems celebratory towards Arya's role, so joy might be the primary emotion here.

Okay, I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion it conveys. Let's see... The tweet is about someone crying at the end of Game of Thrones because Arya saved the day instead of a male hero.

First, the user mentions they cried, which immediately makes me think of sadness or joy. Crying can be bothâ€”sadness if it's because something bad happened, but in this case, Arya being the hero might have been an exciting moment. However, they also express pride and amazement with "My hero ðŸ¤©", so that leans towards positive emotions.

Looking at the content, the user is highlighting Arya's role as a female hero, which was unexpected. The use of emojis like ðŸ¤© adds to the excitement and admiration. They're celebrating Arya's achievement, so it's more about joy and pride rather than sadness.

So, considering all this, the emotion here is likely Joy because they're expressing happiness and amazement at Arya's heroics.
