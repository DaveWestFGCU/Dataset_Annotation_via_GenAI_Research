Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion is conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says: "#Endgame and #GameofThrones both in the one night..... I wasn't prepared for such an emotional rollercoaster!" 

First, let me break down the components of the tweet. The user mentions two major TV events happening on the same night: Endgame (which is a movie, specifically the Avengers: Endgame) and Game of Thrones' last season premiere. Both are significant because they're popular and have large fanbases.

The phrase "I wasn't prepared for such an emotional rollercoaster!" suggests that the person experienced a range of emotions throughout the evening. The word "emotional rollercoaster" implies ups and downs, which can relate to excitement, surprise, maybe even some stress or overwhelm.

Now, looking at the options provided:

1. Anger
2. Disgust
3. Fear
4. Joy
5. Sadness
6. Surprise

I need to figure out which emotion best fits. The tweet doesn't explicitly state any negative emotions like anger or disgust. It's more about being unprepared for a mix of emotions. So, is it surprise? Because the person didn't expect such an intense emotional experience.

Alternatively, could it be joy or sadness? Joy would imply happiness, but the rollercoaster could have both highs and lows. Sadness might relate to negative feelings, but again, the tweet seems more about being surprised by the unexpected emotional impact.

Another angle: The user is talking about two big events happening on the same night. Maybe they didn't anticipate how much these two would affect them emotionally. So, surprise fits here because it's about not expecting such an outcome.

Wait, could it be fear? Like anxiety about the events? But the tweet doesn't convey fear; it's more about being overwhelmed by emotions, which is closer to surprise.

So, putting it together, the emotion conveyed is likely surprise.

The author conveys a sense of surprise due to the unexpected emotional impact of experiencing two major events in one night.

**Surprise**

Okay, let's figure out which emotion this tweet is conveying. The tweet says: "#Endgame and #GameofThrones both in the one night..... I wasn't prepared for such an emotional rollercoaster!" 

First, the user mentions two movies or TV shows: Endgame (which I know is a Marvel movie) and Game of Thrones. Both are popular and have strong emotional content. They're saying that watching them both in one night was unexpected.

The key phrase here is "emotional rollercoaster." That suggests a lot of ups and downs emotionally. So the author felt various emotions while watching these two. But which emotion from the list is most relevant?

Looking at the options: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise. 

"Emotional rollercoaster" implies a mix of different feelings, but since I have to pick one, I need to see what stands out. The user might have felt surprised by how intense both shows were. They weren't prepared for such an emotional experience in one night.

So maybe the emotion is surprise because they weren't expecting such a strong emotional impact. Alternatively, it could be sadness or joy if those were the predominant feelings from the rollercoaster. But "emotional rollercoaster" itself doesn't specify the direction. However, considering that Game of Thrones's last season premiered in April 2019 and was likely memorable, maybe the user felt a mix but primarily surprise because it was unexpected.

I think the most fitting emotion is Surprise because they weren't prepared for such an intense emotional experience.

The tweet expresses Surprise due to the unexpected intensity of emotions from watching both movies. 

**Answer: 6. Surprise**

Alright, let's try to figure out what emotion is behind this tweet. The user wrote: "#Endgame and #GameofThrones both in the one night..... I wasn't prepared for such an emotional rollercoaster!" 

First, I need to understand what each part of the tweet means. They're mentioning two movies or shows: Endgame (which I think is Avengers: Endgame) and Game of Thrones. Both were big events when they premiered. The user says they weren't prepared for an emotional rollercoaster.

So, "emotional rollercoaster" suggests a lot of ups and downs in feelings. But what emotion does that point to? Looking at the options:

1. Anger
2. Disgust
3. Fear
4. Joy
5. Sadness
6. Surprise

Emotional rollercoasters can cover various emotions, but the key here is the context of watching these two big premieres in one night. Both were highly anticipated and had strong emotional impacts on their fans.

Avengers: Endgame was the culmination of a long story arc, leading to emotional highs and maybe some sadness for the character deaths. Game of Thrones, especially its last season, was divisive; many viewers felt disappointed or upset because of how it ended, which could have been unexpected or disappointing.

The user didn't prepare for such an emotional ride, implying that the experience was intense and perhaps more than they expected. But which emotion is dominant? 

If I think about the last season of Game of Thrones, a lot of people felt disappointment or sadness because their favorite characters died or storylines weren't resolved well. So maybe it's Sadness.

Alternatively, if the rollercoaster refers to both highs and lows, could it be Surprise? But surprise is more about unexpected events rather than an emotional journey. 

But the user is expressing that they weren't prepared for such a strong emotional experience. If Endgame was a lot of joy but Game of Thrones' ending caused sadness or disappointment, the overall feeling might lean towards Sadness because of the negative emotions associated with GoT's ending.

So I think Sadness is the most relevant emotion here.
