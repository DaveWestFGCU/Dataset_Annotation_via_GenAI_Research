Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion behind this tweet about the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire. The user wrote, "i cry for my brothers in Paris and for those affected by #NotreDameCathedralFire to give my support i will do 1 benchpress for each year it has stood #inspo #gym". 

First, let me break this down. The tweet starts with the author crying for their brothers in Paris and those affected by the fire. Crying usually indicates sadness or grief. They express sympathy towards the people impacted by the disaster.

Next, the author mentions they will do 1 benchpress for each year the cathedral has stood. This seems like a form of support or solidarity, showing dedication and care. The hashtags used are #inspo (inspiration) and #gym, which suggest the act is both motivational and related to physical activity as a way to contribute.

Looking at the emotion list: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise. The tweet clearly expresses sadness through the crying part. There's also a sense of empathy towards those affected, which aligns with sadness rather than other emotions like anger or fear.

I don't think it's surprise because there's no indication of astonishment; instead, it's more about reacting to the event with sorrow. There's no obvious expression of joy or serenity either. So, Sadness is the most fitting emotion here.

Alright, I need to figure out which emotion the author of this tweet is conveying. The options are Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, or Surprise.

Looking at the tweet: "i cry for my brothers in Paris and for those affected by #NotreDameCathedralFire to give my support i will do 1 benchpress for each year it has stood #inspo #gym"

The author starts by saying they cry, which immediately makes me think of sadness. They express sympathy for their brothers in Paris and those affected by the fire. Crying is a strong indicator of Sadness or maybe even Grief.

Then, the author mentions doing bench presses as an act of support, one for each year the cathedral has stood. This shows empathy and an attempt to contribute positively during a tough time. While this action might seem positive, the primary emotion expressed is still Sadness because they're reacting to the destruction caused by the fire.

I don't see any signs of Anger here; it's more about mourning rather than frustration. Disgust isn't present eitherâ€”there's no indication of dislike or aversion. Fear doesn't come into play, nor does Joy or Surprise. The focus is on the emotional impact of the event and showing support.

So, putting it all together, the emotion here is clearly Sadness.

Alright, let's take a look at this tweet. The user is talking about the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire in Paris. They mention crying for their brothers in Paris and those affected by the fire. That clearly shows empathy and sadness. They also express support by doing bench presses for each year the cathedral stood, which might be an attempt to show solidarity or raise awareness.

So, considering the emotions listed, I need to pick the most relevant one. Anger doesn't fit because there's no expression of frustration or rage. Disgust isn't here either; it's more about feeling negative without necessarily sadness. Fear isn't present; the tweet is about supporting, not fearing. Joy? No, definitely not. The context is a tragedy.

Sadness fits perfectly because they're expressing grief and support for those affected. They're showing compassion, which aligns with sadness. Surprise might be if there was shock, but their focus is more on the emotional impact rather than being surprised.
