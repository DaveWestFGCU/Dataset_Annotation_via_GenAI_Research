Alright, I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion conveyed. The user is talking about the violence in Venezuela, mentioning civil war and deaths daily. They also bring up people dying in hospitals because of lack of medicine and food. That's pretty serious and sad. 

Looking at the options: anger might be there due to the situation, but the primary feeling seems to be sadness because they're highlighting suffering and loss. So, I think Sadness is the most fitting emotion here.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what emotion this tweet is conveying. The user provided a list of emotions: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise. I need to pick the most relevant one.

First, let me read the tweet carefully. It says: "What more of a civil war than the rampant violence on the streets, everyday? Do you happen to know how many violent deaths there are in #Venezuela every day? Not even counting the people dying in hospitals due to lack of medicine and food. But hey, we're resilient, let's wait!"

Breaking it down, the tweet is talking about violence on the streets, daily violent deaths, and people dying in hospitals because they don't have enough medicine or food. These are all pretty heavy topics. The tone seems serious and negative.

The first part expresses frustration with the ongoing violence, questioning if it's even worse than a civil war. That sounds like Anger or maybe Disgust. Then, pointing out the lack of healthcare adds to the severity, showing concern or sadness about the situation.

At the end, they say "we're resilient, let's wait." This seems hopeful but given the context, it might be sarcastic or a coping mechanism rather than actual joy. It doesn't feel like Joy because the overall message is about suffering and resilience in the face of hardship.

Looking at the emotions: Anger could fit because of frustration over violence. Disgust involves dislike or aversion, which isn't exactly what's being expressed here—it’s more about the situation rather than something disgusting. Fear would involve anxiety about future events, but the tweet is focused on current issues. Sadness makes sense because they're talking about people dying and suffering, which evokes pity or sorrow.

So between Anger and Sadness, I think Sadness is a better fit because the primary emotion seems to be sorrow over the tragedy happening in Venezuela.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion it conveys. The options are Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, or Surprise.

Looking at the tweet: It talks about violence on the streets in Venezuela and mentions daily deaths, people dying in hospitals due to lack of medicine and food. Then it ends with a sarcastic "But hey, we're resilient, let's wait!"

The first part is clearly negative. The mention of violence, death, and suffering sounds like Sadness or maybe Disgust because of the harsh conditions.

However, the last sentence is more sarcastic and ironic. It uses "we're resilient" in a way that mocks the situation, suggesting that despite the hardships, there's no real positive outlook. This sarcasm could also convey Anger, as it's a reaction to the ongoing crisis.

So between Sadness and Anger. The tweet isn't just expressing sorrow; it's reacting with frustration to the ongoing issues. That makes me think it's more about Anger.
