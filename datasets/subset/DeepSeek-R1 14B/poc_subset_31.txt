The hashtags are #messi, #LaLiga, and #BarçaLevante, all related to football.

Looking at the possible emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. This tweet doesn't show any negative feelings like anger or disgust. There's no indication of fear or anxiety. Sadness isn't present either; instead, it's clearly positive.
