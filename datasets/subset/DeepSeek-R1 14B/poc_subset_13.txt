Okay, I need to classify the emotion in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user says they're "just so angry" and uses strong language like "fucking stupid dumb big piece of shit." They also mention that their favorite show went from being okay ("meh") to becoming terrible in the last two seasons. 

Looking at the options, anger is clearly present here because they explicitly state feeling angry and use harsh words. There's no indication of other emotions like fear or sadness; it's all about frustration and disappointment directed at the show's quality. So, the emotion conveyed is Anger.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a tweet and wants it classified into one of six emotions: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, or Surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says, "I'm just so angry because my absolute favourite show turned from 'meh it gotten kinda shitty (Season 5 to 6) to 'what a fucking stupid dumb big piece of shit filled garbage' (the last two seasons)." The user is clearly expressing strong negative feelings about the show's later seasons.

Looking at the emotion list, Anger includes annoyance and rage. The tweet uses words like "angry," "shitty," and "garbage," which are strong indicators of frustration and anger. There's also a clear disappointment expressed towards the show's decline in quality.

Disgust is another possibility since the user describes the show as "shit" and "garbage." However, the primary emotion here seems to be the intense dissatisfaction and rage rather than just disgust. The use of profanity emphasizes the frustration more than mere dislike.

I don't see elements of Fear, Joy, Sadness beyond what's covered by Anger, or Surprise in this tweet. It's all about the strong negative reaction towards the show's quality decline.

So, considering all this, the most fitting emotion is Anger.

Alright, let's break this down. The user has given me a query where I need to classify the emotion in a tweet about Game of Thrones. First, I'll read the tweet carefully.

The author says they're "just so angry" and lists their experience with the show: they liked it until Season 5-6, but the last two seasons were "shitty." They even use strong language like "fucking stupid dumb big piece of shit filled garbage."

Looking at the emotion categories provided—anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise—I need to pick the most relevant one. The tweet explicitly mentions anger, using words like "angry" and "stupid," which fall under the anger category.

But wait, could it be both anger and disgust? Disgust includes dislike or厌恶. The author clearly expresses dislike for the later seasons, but they start by stating their anger. Since they use "angry" directly and focus more on frustration rather than pure dislike, I think anger is the primary emotion here.

I should also consider if any other emotions might fit, like sadness or disappointment. However, the tweet doesn't express grief or pensiveness; it's more about frustration and irritation.

So, the classification should be Anger because that's the emotion explicitly stated and the strongest indicator in the text.
