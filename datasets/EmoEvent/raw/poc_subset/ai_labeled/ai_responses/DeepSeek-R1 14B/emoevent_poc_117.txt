Okay, so I have to classify this tweet: "Done it since I was a kid I was very edgy." The goal is to figure out which emotion the author intended to convey from the given list. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the tweet is saying. The person mentions they've been doing something since childhood and that they were "very edgy." Now, "edgy" can mean a few things. It could refer to being on an edge, like being at risk or almost falling off, but in this context, it's more likely describing someone who is edgy as in being unconventional, bold, or perhaps risky in behavior.

So the tweet seems to be sharing that they've been doing something since childhood and that they were very edgy. The tone here isn't overtly positive or negative, but "edgy" can sometimes carry a slightly negative connotation, implying maybe recklessness or being on the edge of trouble.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to pick one that fits best. 

Let's consider each option:
- Anger: The tweet doesn't express any frustration or rage.
- Disgust: There's no indication of dislike or disinterest here.
- Fear: No signs of anxiety or apprehension.
- Joy: The word "edgy" doesn't sound joyful, unless it's about being enthusiastic, but that's a stretch.
- Sadness: Doesn't seem to apply as there's no clear sadness expressed.
- Surprise: Not really, since the statement is straightforward.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. "Edgy" could imply someone was on the edge of doing something, like taking risks or being in a risky situation. But does that relate to any emotion category? Maybe fear, as being edgy might involve anxiety or risk-taking due to fear?

Alternatively, "edgy" can also be slang for being stylish or trendy, but that's more about presentation rather than emotion. However, the context here is doing something since childhood, so it's more about behavior.

If I think of someone who was very edgy as a kid, they might have been on the verge of getting into trouble, which could relate to fear or anxiety, but not necessarily. Alternatively, maybe it's just a way of expressing that they were bold without any negative emotion attached.

Wait, perhaps "edgy" is simply describing their personality trait without conveying an emotion. But since we need to pick from the given list, and none directly match a personality trait, I have to infer based on possible emotions associated with being edgy.

If someone is very edgy, they might be taking risks because of fear or anxiety? Or maybe it's more about their behavior rather than the emotion itself. Hmm.

Alternatively, could "edgy" here be used metaphorically to mean that they were on the edge emotionally, like in a stressful situation? That might lean towards fear or anxiety, which falls under fear category.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look for more clues in the tweet. The person says they've been doing it since childhood and were very edgy. There's no explicit emotion mentioned, but perhaps the implication is that being edgy was a response to something else, like fear or anxiety.

Alternatively, maybe "edgy" just describes their past behavior without implying any current emotion, so perhaps none of the categories fit, but I have to choose one.

Wait, looking back at the instructions: classify based on the intended emotion. So maybe the author is trying to convey that they were edgy because of something else, like fear or anxiety?

Alternatively, maybe it's a neutral statement without any emotion, but since I have to pick from the list, perhaps surprise? Because "edgy" could mean unexpected behavior.

But I'm not confident about that. Alternatively, maybe it's just describing past behavior and doesn't necessarily convey an emotion, so maybe the closest is joy if they're talking about something positive they've been doing. But "edgy" isn't typically a joyful term.

Alternatively, perhaps surprise? Because being edgy might imply doing something unexpected or surprising.

Wait, but I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the intended emotion is simply to state their past behavior without any emotional connotation, but since I have to pick one, maybe surprise because they're pointing out an edginess that others might find surprising.

Alternatively, perhaps sadness if "edgy" refers to being on the edge of something negative, like sadness or grief. But I'm not sure.

I think I need to make a best guess here. The tweet is about past behavior described as edgy. The emotion category that could fit is surprise because "edgy" might imply doing something unexpected or surprising. Alternatively, maybe fear if it's about being on the edge of danger.

But I'm leaning towards surprise because "edgy" can be seen as a bit surprising or attention-grabbing behavior.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet: "Done it since I was a kid I was very edgy." The task is to figure out the emotion conveyed by the author from the given list of emotions. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let's break down the tweet. The person says they've been doing something since they were a kid and that they were "very edgy." Now, "edgy" typically refers to being bold or daring, often in a way that might be considered risky or unconventional. But does it convey an emotion? Or is it more about their personality trait?

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to match the tweet to one of these.

The phrase "very edgy" doesn't directly express any primary emotion. It describes a personality trait or style. However, sometimes boldness can be associated with confidence, which might lean towards joy or serenity if it's about being calm and confident. Alternatively, being edgy could also hint at a slight sense of defiance or maybe even a bit of irritability, but that's stretching it.

Wait, another angle: the person is talking about their past behavior since childhood. If they were "edgy," perhaps this was in a rebellious way. Rebellion can sometimes be linked to anger or frustration, but I'm not sure if that's the primary emotion here. Alternatively, being edgy might just describe their personality without expressing an emotion.

Looking back at the emotion list: surprise isn't applicable because there's no unexpected event mentioned. Fear? Maybe not unless they were scared of something, which isn't indicated. Disgust or dislike doesn't seem to fit either. Anger could be a stretch if being edgy is seen as acting out due to anger, but it's more about behavior than emotion.

Joy or serenity might be possible if "edgy" refers to a carefree or bold attitude that brings joy. Alternatively, the tweet might not express any strong emotion and is just stating a fact about their past behavior.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key word is "edgy." In modern slang, "edgy" can mean someone who's unconventional or does things that are a bit risky but in a cool way. It doesn't necessarily convey an emotion but rather a trait. However, since we need to map it to the given emotions, perhaps the closest would be joy if they're expressing pride or satisfaction in their edginess.

Alternatively, considering that "edgy" might imply a sense of rebellion without necessarily being angry, maybe the emotion is more about confidence, which could fall under joy or serenity. But I'm not entirely sure because it's more about behavior than an emotional state.

Wait another thought: sometimes people use "edgy" to describe their mood, but in this context, they're talking about their past actions as a kid. So maybe the emotion isn't explicitly stated but inferred from their boldness. If being edgy was part of their way of handling things, perhaps it's more about confidence or joy.

But I'm not 100% certain. Maybe another angle: "edgy" could imply a slight sense of discomfort or irritability, which might be close to anger, but that feels like a stretch. Alternatively, if they're talking about past behavior without any current emotion attached, maybe the emotion is neutral, but we have to choose from the given list.

Wait, perhaps I should consider what "edgy" means in this context. If someone says they've been edgy since childhood, it might mean they were always a bit on the edge, possibly due to anxiety or fear? That could tie into fear. But "edgy" usually isn't directly linked with fear; more with being bold.

Alternatively, maybe the person is expressing a sense of accomplishment or satisfaction in being edgy, which would be joy.

I think I'm leaning towards joy because they might be recalling their past behavior with fondness or pride, indicating a positive emotion. Alternatively, it's possible that "edgy" doesn't express an emotion but just describes their personality, so maybe the tweet doesn't convey any specific emotion from the list. But since we have to choose one, I'll go with joy as the closest fit.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has given me a tweet: "Done it since I was a kid I was very edgy." My task is to classify the emotion conveyed here from the provided list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

First, I'll break down the sentence. The author mentions they've been doing something "since I was a kid," which implies a long-standing habit or action. The key part here is "very edgy." Now, "edgy" can have different connotations. In modern slang, it often means being trendy or fashionable, especially in contexts like clothing or lifestyle choices. However, the term can sometimes carry a negative connotation if someone is being overly critical or harsh.

Looking at the emotion categories:

- Anger: This would involve words indicating frustration or irritation.
- Disgust: Words showing dislike or aversion.
- Fear: Indicators of anxiety or apprehension.
- Joy: Positive emotions like happiness or contentment.
- Sadness: Emotions related to grief or pensiveness.
- Surprise: Could include amazement or distraction.

The phrase "edgy" doesn't seem to express any of the primary positive emotions like joy. It's more likely describing a personality trait rather than an emotion. However, considering the options, if we interpret "edgy" as being critical or annoyed, it might lean towards anger. But I think that's stretching it because the context is about something they've done since childhood, which doesn't inherently suggest anger.

Alternatively, maybe the user is trying to express a unique or standout personality ("edgy"), but that still doesn't fit neatly into any of the emotion categories provided. Since none of the primary emotions seem to align well with "edgy," it's possible there's no strong emotional tone here. But since I need to choose one, perhaps "surprise" is too much a stretch, and "disgust" or "anger" don't fit either.

Wait, maybe "edgy" in this context isn't negative but more about style. So the tweet might just be stating a fact without any strong emotion. But since I have to pick from the given list, perhaps the closest is "joy," but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, if it's meant to convey confidence or uniqueness, which could tie into positive emotions, but joy isn't exactly right either.

Hmm, this is tricky. The tweet might not express a strong emotion as per the categories. But I need to choose one. Maybe the author is expressing satisfaction or contentment with their edgy style since childhood, so that leans towards joy. Alternatively, if "edgy" means being sarcastic or annoyed, it could be anger. But without more context, it's hard to say.

Given the options, I think the safest bet is "anger," interpreting "edgy" as a critical tone. But I'm not entirely confident because "edgy" can have neutral or positive connotations too.
