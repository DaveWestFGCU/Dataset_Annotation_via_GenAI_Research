Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion is being conveyed in this tweet: "> and no one but angry community fanboys have pushed back against his statements." 

First, let's break down the sentence. The author is talking about a situation where only "angry community fanboys" are pushing back against someone's statements. The key word here seems to be "angry," which directly points to anger as an emotion. 

Looking at the possible emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Since the tweet mentions people being angry and acting out of that anger, it makes sense that the primary emotion is anger.

I don't think it's any of the others because there's no indication of disgust (like something being disliked), fear or anxiety isn't mentioned, joy or serenity aren't present, sadness or pensiveness are absent, and surprise would require something unexpected happening. 

So, yeah, the emotion here is definitely anger.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a tweet: "and no one but angry community fanboys have pushed back against his statements." They want me to classify the emotion conveyed in this tweet from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. The author is talking about a situation where only "angry community fanboys" are pushing back against someone's statements. The key words here are "angry," which directly refers to a group of people who are angry. 

I need to identify the emotion the author intends to convey, not just the emotion expressed by others. So, is the author expressing their own anger or pointing out that others are angry? The phrasing suggests the author is noting that it's these fanboys who are reacting with anger.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger includes annoyance and rage. Since the tweet uses "angry" to describe the fanboys, the emotion here seems to be about their anger. However, I have to consider if there's any other emotion the author might be conveying beyond just describing others' emotions.

Is the author frustrated or annoyed? Maybe, but that still falls under anger. There's no indication of disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise in the tweet. The focus is on the angry response from a specific group.

So, the most relevant emotion label here is "anger." The author is pointing out that it's only these angry individuals who are pushing back, which conveys an emotion related to anger.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion based on the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The tweet says, "and no one but angry community fanboys have pushed back against his statements." 

First, let me break down the tweet. It mentions that only "angry community fanboys" are pushing back against someone's statements. The word "angry" is explicitly used here, which immediately makes me think of anger. But I shouldn't just take that word at face value; sometimes words can be tricky or part of a larger context.

Looking deeper, the author is pointing out that the opposition comes from people who are angry and are part of a community, possibly fans or supporters. The use of "fanboys" might carry a slight connotation of enthusiasm but combined with "angry," it's clear they're highlighting frustration or irritation. 

I should consider if any other emotions could be present. Disgust involves feelings like dislike or aversion, but here the focus is more on the intensity of reaction rather than disgust. Fear would imply anxiety or apprehension, which isn't evident in the tweet. Joy and surprise are clearly not applicable as the tone is negative. Sadness might come into play if there's disappointment, but again, the primary emotion seems to be anger.

Also, the structure of the sentence emphasizes that others' reactions are driven by anger, reinforcing that the intended emotion is about irritation or strong displeasure. So putting it all together, the emotion conveyed here is definitely anger.

The tweet explicitly mentions "angry community fanboys," indicating frustration or irritation directed at their opposition. This clearly points to a feeling of anger.
