Okay, I need to classify this tweet into one of the given emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let's look at the tweet: "really odd choose with pairing slack and sunfan together. These 2 should always be paired with a high IQ caster." 

First, the author is talking about pairing two things, Slack and Sunfan, which they find odd. They mention that these two should be paired with someone who has a high IQ. The words "really odd" and "should always be paired" suggest that they're expressing a strong opinion or dissatisfaction.

I'm thinking about the emotion categories. Anger includes annoyance and rage. Dislike is part of disgust, but here it seems more like frustration rather than pure dislike. Fear would involve worry or anxiety, which doesn't seem to fit here. Joy and surprise are positive emotions, so they're unlikely. Sadness might be involved if there's disappointment, but the main emotion here feels more like irritation.

The author is criticizing the pairing, which shows annoyance. So I think anger is the most appropriate category.

Alright, let's try to figure out the emotion in this tweet. The user says, "really odd choose with pairing slack and sunfan together. These 2 should always be paired with a high IQ caster." Hmm, okay.

First, I need to understand what they're talking about. It seems like they're discussing something related to gaming or maybe strategy, given the terms like "pairing" and "caster," which might refer to someone casting spells in a game. The user is pointing out that pairing these two characters (Slack and Sunfan) together is odd because they should be paired with someone who has a high IQ.

Now, looking at their emotion. They use words like "really odd," which suggests surprise or maybe confusion. They didn't expect this pairing to happen. There's no obvious anger, disgust, fear, or sadness here. It's more about the unexpectedness of the situation.

So, considering the options: anger is not present because they're not expressing frustration. Disgust would imply dislike, but the tweet isn't negative in that way. Fear and anxiety aren't there either. Sadness doesn't fit because it's more about surprise at an unusual choice.

The key emotion here seems to be surprise, specifically amazement or confusion about why these two are paired without a high IQ caster. So, I think the right classification is **surprise**.

**surprise**

Alright, let's break down this tweet to determine the emotion conveyed. The user wrote: "really odd choose with pairing slack and sunfan together. These 2 should always be paired with a high IQ caster." 

First, looking at the words used like "really odd" indicates surprise or unexpectedness. They're pointing out that the pairing is unusual. The phrase "should always be paired with a high IQ caster" suggests they have a strong opinion about how these two should be matched with someone of higher intelligence.

The overall tone seems to express astonishment at the current pairing and maybe frustration because it's not what they expected. However, since the primary emotion here is pointing out something unexpected in a critical way, I think surprise fits better than frustration or anger.

So, considering all this, the emotion conveyed is **surprise**.

The tweet expresses surprise at an unusual pairing and suggests that it should be different. 

**surprise**
