Okay, so I have to classify this tweet into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The tweet says, "Love hearing stories like this. [NAME] holy Priests are such a gift. We must always give thanks and pray for them." 

First, let me read it carefully. The author starts with "Love hearing stories," which immediately suggests positive feelings. They mention that the priests are a "gift" and emphasize gratitude by saying we should give thanks and pray for them.

Breaking down the words: "love" is a strong indicator of joy or affection. "Gift" implies something positive and valuable, adding to the positive sentiment. Expressions like "give thanks" and "pray" are associated with gratitude and reverence, which are joyful emotions.

Looking at each emotion category:

- Anger: Doesn't fit because there's no sign of irritation or rage.
- Disgust: No elements of dislike or disinterest here.
- Fear: There's no indication of apprehension or anxiety.
- Sadness: The overall tone is positive, so sadness isn't applicable.
- Surprise: While the content might be surprising, the primary emotion seems to be appreciation rather than amazement.

Therefore, the emotion conveyed here is joy because the author expresses love, gratitude, and reverence towards the priests in a positive manner. There's no negative or neutral sentiment; it's clearly uplifting and joyful.

Okay, let's try to figure out what emotion is in this tweet. The tweet says, "Love hearing stories like this. [NAME] holy Priests are such a gift. We must always give thanks and pray for them." 

First, I notice the words "love" and "gift," which usually indicate positive feelings. The author is expressing appreciation and gratitude towards the priests mentioned. They also use phrases like "give thanks" and "pray," which shows respect and devotion.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Since the tweet is about love and gratitude, it's clearly a positive emotion. Joy fits here because it includes feelings of serenity or ecstasy, which can come from being thankful or moved by something positive.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, or surprise. Sadness isn't present either since the tone is uplifting. So, joy is definitely the right choice.
