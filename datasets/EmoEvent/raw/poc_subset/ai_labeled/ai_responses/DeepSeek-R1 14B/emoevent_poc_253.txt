Alright, let's try to figure out what emotion is behind this tweet: "Don’t forget sports gambling. THEN we’ll be happy." So, first off, I need to consider the context and the wording used.

The user mentions not forgetting sports gambling and then says that after that, people will be happy. The word "THEN" seems important here because it suggests a cause-and-effect relationship. They're implying that once sports gambling is considered or done, happiness follows.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to pick one that fits best.

The phrase "we'll be happy" directly points towards positive emotions. Joy and serenity are part of the 'joy' category. There's no indication of negative emotions like anger or sadness here. The mention of sports gambling doesn't carry any negative connotations unless there's an underlying issue, but in this context, it seems to be a neutral activity that leads to happiness.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed is joy because they're anticipating something positive happening after including sports gambling.

Alright, let's take a look at this tweet: "Don’t forget sports gambling. THEN we’ll be happy." The user is talking about sports gambling and says that after considering it, they'll be happy. I need to classify the emotion here.

First, the mention of sports gambling doesn't inherently carry an emotion. It's more of a suggestion or reminder. Then the phrase "THEN we’ll be happy" suggests that whatever comes before (sports gambling) is a step towards happiness. So, the author seems to be expressing anticipation or looking forward to something positive happening.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The key word here is "happy," which falls under joy. However, since it's about future happiness, does that mean it's more of an expectation rather than immediate joy? But in emotional classification, "joy" includes serenity and ecstasy, but also anticipation can be tied to joy because it's a positive emotion.

I don't think it's surprise because there's no indication of unexpectedness. Fear or anger don't seem applicable here either. Disgust is about dislike, which isn't present. Sadness is obviously not the case. So the most fitting emotion would be joy, specifically in terms of looking forward to something positive.

Alright, let me try to figure out what emotion is in this tweet: "Don't forget sports gambling. THEN we'll be happy." So first, I need to break down the message. The author is talking about sports gambling and says that after including it, people will be happy.

I'm thinking about each emotion category. Anger doesn't seem right because there's no indication of frustration or rage. Disgust? No, they don’t show any dislike or disinterest in the tweet. Fear? Not really, since there’s nothing scary or anxiety-inducing here.

Now, joy seems like a good fit. They mention that after sports gambling, people will be happy. That sounds positive and enthusiastic. Sadness isn't applicable because it's not expressing grief or pensiveness. Surprise? There's no element of amazement or distraction in the message.

So putting it all together, the emotion is joy because they're associating sports gambling with happiness.
