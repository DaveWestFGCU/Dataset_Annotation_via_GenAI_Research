Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion behind this tweet: "How she used the entire video without any editing.... that's copyright." Alright, let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. The author is pointing out that someone used an entire video without editing and mentions copyright. Hmm, so they're probably talking about a situation where content was copied or reused without permission, which is against copyright laws.

Now, considering the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to pick one that best fits the author's intent.

Let me think about each emotion:

1. **Anger**: This would be if the tweet expresses frustration or irritation. But does it seem like the author is angry? Maybe not necessarily, but it's a possibility.

2. **Disgust**: Disgust includes dislike or disinterest. The mention of copyright might imply that the author doesn't approve of this action, so perhaps there's some disgust here because they're pointing out an issue they find distasteful.

3. **Fear**: Fear would involve anxiety or apprehension. I don't think the tweet is expressing fear; it's more about someone else's actions.

4. **Joy**: Definitely not. The content isn't positive or happy.

5. **Sadness**: Sadness might come from disapproval, but in this case, the author seems more critical rather than sad.

6. **Surprise**: Surprise would be if they were amazed or distracted by something unexpected, which doesn't seem to fit here.

So narrowing it down, anger and disgust are possibilities. The tweet is pointing out an issue (copyright violation) that someone else did without editing. It's a critique of another person's action, possibly because the author feels it was wrong or unfair.

Is there any indication of frustration? Maybe, but I think the emotion here is more about disapproval rather than pure anger. So disgust seems more fitting because they're expressing dislike for the action taken by "she."

Wait, but sometimes when people point out others' mistakes, especially in a public way like on social media, they can be frustrated or even angry. But the key words are "without any editing" and "that's copyright." It sounds more like the author is highlighting an issue they find problematic, which aligns with disgust rather than anger.

So I think the emotion here is disgust because it's about disliking someone else's action that they perceive as wrong.

Okay, I need to classify this tweet's emotion. The tweet is: "How she used the entire video without any editing.... that’s copyright". Let me break it down.

First, the author is talking about someone using a video without editing. That might imply they're upset or annoyed because maybe they own the content and didn't give permission, hence the mention of copyright issues. The word "without" could suggest frustration.

But looking at the emotion list: anger includes annoyance, so that's possible. Alternatively, maybe surprise? But the tweet doesn't seem surprised; more like a statement of fact or complaint.

No other emotions fit here. It's not fear, disgust, joy, or sadness. So, I think it's anger because they're pointing out an issue someone else did without permission, likely irritating them.

Alright, let's break down this tweet: "How she used the entire video without any editing.... that's copyright." The user is pointing out that someone used an entire video without editing and mentions copyright. So, they're probably upset or annoyed about it.

Looking at the emotion categories, anger includes annoyance and rage. The mention of copyright issues suggests frustration, which falls under anger. There's no indication of disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise here. It's more about being bothered by someone else's actions regarding content ownership.

So, I think the intended emotion is **anger**.

**anger**
