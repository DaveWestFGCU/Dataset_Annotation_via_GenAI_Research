Alright, let's tackle this tweet classification task step by step. The tweet is: "I fat fingered it haha I meant 18". 

First, I need to understand the content and the emotion conveyed here. The user mentions "fat fingered", which usually refers to a typo or mistake while typing. They followed it with "haha", indicating they find it amusing or funny.

Now, considering the emotion categories provided: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. 

- Anger doesn't seem applicable here because there's no indication of frustration or rage.
- Disgust and disinterest aren't present; the user isn't expressing dislike for something.
- Fear or anxiety isn't evident in the tweet either.
- Sadness or grief is not the emotion here, as the user is laughing it off.
- Surprise might be a possibility because making a mistake can be surprising, but the laughter suggests it's more about amusement.

Joy and serenity fit well because the user is finding humor in their mistake. The "haha" explicitly shows they're amused, which falls under joy. So, despite the minor error, the predominant emotion is positive and joyful.

The tweet expresses amusement and laughter over a minor mistake, which conveys joy.
