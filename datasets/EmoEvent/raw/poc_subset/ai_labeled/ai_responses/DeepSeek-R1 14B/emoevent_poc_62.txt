Alright, so I need to classify the emotion of this tweet: "Let them argue. We've never done anything remotely as bad as MOST OF THE WORLD does routinely." The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, let me read the tweet carefully. It seems like the author is talking about a situation where others are arguing, and they're responding by saying that their own actions aren't as bad as what most of the world does. 

Breaking it down: "Let them argue." This could indicate some level of frustration or dismissal towards the argument. The second part says, "We've never done anything remotely as bad as MOST OF THE WORLD does routinely." Here, they're comparing their actions to others and pointing out that they aren't as bad.

The key words here are "remotely as bad" and "MOST OF THE WORLD." This comparison suggests the author might be feeling disapproval or condemnation towards how most people act. They could be expressing disgust because they see the world's behavior as negative, which they find distasteful or unacceptable.

I don't think it's anger because the tweet isn't directly attacking someone but rather making a statement about the state of the world. It's more about the sentiment towards others' actions rather than an outburst. Disgust fits better here because it involves feelings of disapproval or aversion, which seems to align with their comparison.

Fear would involve worry or anxiety, but there's no indication of that in the tweet. Sadness might be if they were expressing sorrow about something, but this doesn't seem to fit either. Joy and surprise are clearly not applicable here as the tone isn't positive or surprising.

So, considering all options, disgust seems like the most fitting emotion because the author is showing disapproval towards how most of the world behaves.

Alright, I need to classify this tweet's emotion using only the given categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

The tweet says: "Let them argue. We've never done anything remotely as bad as MOST OF THE WORLD does routinely."

Looking at the wording, the author is making a statement comparing their actions to the rest of the world's. The use of "remotely as bad" and "MOST OF THE WORLD" suggests frustration or criticism towards others. This indicates that the author might be feeling annoyed or upset.

Frustration often falls under anger because it involves irritation or annoyance. There's no clear sign of disgust, which would involve dislike or aversion, though the comparison could imply that. However, the primary emotion seems to be more about frustration and maybe defensiveness, which aligns with anger.

I don't see elements pointing towards fear (no threat mentioned), joy, sadness, or surprise. The main sentiment is a critique of others' actions, expressing mild anger.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out what emotion is being conveyed in this tweet: "Let them argue. We've never done anything remotely as bad as MOST OF THE WORLD does routinely." 

First, let me break down the sentence. The author starts by saying "Let them argue," which suggests they're okay with others having disagreements or perhaps dismissing the argument as unimportant. Then they compare themselves to "MOST OF THE WORLD," indicating that the world does worse things.

I need to consider the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Let's analyze each possible fit:

1. **Anger**: The tweet doesn't show irritation or rage; it seems more like a statement rather than an expression of anger.
2. **Disgust**: There's no clear indication of dislike or aversion towards something mentioned in the tweet.
3. **Fear**: No signs of anxiety or apprehension here.
4. **Joy**: The tone doesn't suggest happiness or serenity; it's more about comparing actions.
5. **Sadness**: There's no overt sadness or grief expressed.
6. **Surprise**: The statement is factual and not something surprising.

The author seems to be making a comparison, suggesting that their actions aren't as bad as the world's. This could imply judgment on others' behavior but without explicit emotion words. However, considering the context, it might convey a sense of disgust because they're pointing out that most of the world does worse things, which could be a way to express disapproval or dislike towards those actions.

So, the emotion here is likely **disgust**.
</think>

The tweet expresses **disgust**, as the author judges others' actions negatively. 

**Answer:** *The emotion conveyed in the tweet is **disgust***.
