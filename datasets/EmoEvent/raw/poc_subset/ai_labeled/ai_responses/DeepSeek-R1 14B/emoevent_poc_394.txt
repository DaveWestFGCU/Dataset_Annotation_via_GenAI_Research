Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion this tweet is conveying. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me read the tweet again: "This wasn’t last year. It was last century! Star Wars had just come out!" 

Hmm, the user is talking about something happening not just recently but way back in the past—like from the last century. They mention that Star Wars had just come out, which I know happened in the late '70s or early '80s. So this person is probably expressing surprise because they're highlighting how long ago it was and referencing a significant event like Star Wars' release. 

Wait, could it be another emotion? Let's see—anger doesn't seem right because there's no indication of frustration or irritation. Disgust isn't here either; the tone doesn't show dislike or disapproval. Fear is also not present; there's no sense of worry or anxiety. Sadness? I don't think so, as the message seems more about pointing out something unexpected rather than expressing sorrow. 

So yeah, surprise makes the most sense here. The tweet is drawing attention to an event that happened a long time ago with a pop culture reference, which would likely make someone go "Wow, really?" or feel amazed.

Okay, so I need to classify the emotion in this tweet: "This wasn’t last year. It was last century! Star Wars had just come out!" The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

First, let me read the tweet again. The author is comparing something from "last year" to "last century," which suggests a big time gap. Then they mention that Star Wars had just come out, probably referring to the original trilogy, which was in the late '70s and early '80s.

Hmm, so maybe the author is expressing surprise because they're pointing out how long ago something happened. They might be surprised at the passage of time or how something old is being referenced again. The exclamation marks also indicate excitement or surprise.

I don't think it's anger because there's no indication of frustration or irritation. Disgust? No, that would involve dislike, and the tone here seems positive about Star Wars. Fear? I don't see any signs of anxiety or worry. Sadness? There's a nostalgic element but not necessarily sadness. So the most fitting emotion is surprise.

Alright, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

The tweet is: "This wasn’t last year. It was last century! Star Wars had just come out!"

First, let me read through it carefully. The author is making a comparison between two time frames—last year and last century. They mention that Star Wars came out, which I know was in the late '70s or early '80s. So referring to it as "last century" suggests something from way back.

Now, looking at the emotion list: anger is about annoyance or rage; disgust includes dislike; fear involves apprehension; joy is happiness or serenity; sadness is pensiveness or grief; surprise is about amazement or distraction.

The tone here seems a bit nostalgic. They're pointing out that something was way older than just last year, which might evoke memories of the past. But none of these emotions directly point to nostalgia. So I need to see if it fits into any of the given categories.

The exclamation marks suggest excitement or emphasis, but is there any indication of a specific emotion? They're not expressing anger or dislike; more like they're highlighting how old something was in an emphatic way. Maybe they're surprised at how long ago it was?

Wait, "last century" sounds夸张 (exaggerated), which can come off as surprising. The mention of Star Wars coming out might be referencing its initial release, which was a big deal and could elicit feelings of amazement.

So perhaps the emotion here is surprise because they're emphasizing the time gap in an unexpected way.

The tweet uses exaggerated language to highlight how long ago something happened, evoking a sense of amazement or distraction.
