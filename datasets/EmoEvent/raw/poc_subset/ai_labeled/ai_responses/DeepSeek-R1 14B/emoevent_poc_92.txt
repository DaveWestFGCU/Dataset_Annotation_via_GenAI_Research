Alright, so I've got this tweet to classify into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The tweet is: "I'm super proud of him. Great guy!" 

First, I'll break down the words used. "Super proud" immediately stands out as a strong positive emotion. The word "proud" itself usually conveys happiness or satisfaction. Adding "super" amplifies that feeling, making it even more enthusiastic.

Next, "Great guy!" is another positive statement. It's a compliment, which typically brings joy to both the speaker and the subject. The exclamation mark at the end suggests excitement or delight, further indicating a positive emotion.

Looking at the emotion categories:
- Anger isn't present here; there's no indication of frustration or irritation.
- Disgust is about dislike, which doesn't fit the context of pride and praise.
- Fear would involve anxiety or dread, but the tweet is uplifting.
- Sadness involves grief or pensiveness, which contradicts the positive tone.
- Surprise implies unexpectedness, but while commendation can be surprising, "super proud" feels more directly about joy.

Joy seems to encapsulate both pride and enthusiasm. The author is expressing satisfaction and happiness, so it's the most fitting category among those provided.

Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion conveyed in this tweet: "I’m super proud of him. Great guy!" Alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the words used. The author says they're "super proud," which immediately makes me think of positive emotions. Pride is definitely a strong indicator here. The use of "super" emphasizes the intensity of that pride.

Next, "Great guy!" adds to that positivity. Complimenting someone as great shows approval and happiness towards them. There's no negative language here; everything seems upbeat and encouraging.

Now, considering the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet doesn't show any signs of anger or frustration because it's all about positive feelings. Disgust isn't present either—no words that imply dislike or aversion. Fear and anxiety don't come into play here; there's no indication of worry or concern.

Looking at the remaining options: joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet is definitely not expressing sadness or pensiveness. It's more about celebrating someone else's achievements, so surprise might be considered if something unexpected happened, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed is joy. The author feels happy and proud, which falls under the joy category.
