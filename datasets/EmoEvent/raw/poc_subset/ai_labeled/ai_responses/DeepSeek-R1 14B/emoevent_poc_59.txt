Okay, I need to classify this tweet into one of the six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me look at the tweet again: "I do not see how that is disgusting. She's cleaning herself and had a discharge, so what?"

First, the author is addressing someone else's perspective on something being disgusting. They're saying they don't understand why it would be considered disgusting. The context mentions cleaning oneself and having a discharge, which could relate to bodily functions or hygiene.

Looking at the emotion categories:

1. **Anger**: This might come into play if there's frustration or irritation, but I don't see strong indicators of that here.
2. **Disgust**: The tweet is directly about not finding something disgusting. However, since the author is dismissing the idea of disgust and perhaps showing their own reaction to it, maybe this relates. But wait, the emotion categories are what the author intends to convey. So if they're saying it's not disgusting, does that mean they feel disgusted or do they feel another emotion about someone else feeling disgusted?
3. **Fear**: There's no indication of fear here.
4. **Joy**: The tweet doesn't express any positive emotions.
5. **Sadness**: Again, nothing suggests sadness.
6. **Surprise**: Maybe if the author is surprised by the situation, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the author is expressing disgust themselves. They might be upset about something being called disgusting. So maybe they are feeling disgusted by the situation or someone else's reaction. Alternatively, they could be annoyed (which falls under anger), but I'm not sure.

But looking back, the instruction says to classify based on what emotion the author intended to convey. If they're saying "I do not see how that is disgusting," perhaps they are expressing their own disgust because they find it so. Or maybe they're dismissing someone else's disgust, which could imply their own reaction.

Alternatively, considering the content involves cleaning and discharge, it might relate to a medical or personal situation that people might find gross, hence the author's response indicates they feel disgusted by such an attitude.

I think the most fitting emotion here is **disgust**, as the tweet is about something being considered disgusting.

**disgust**

Alright, I need to classify this tweet into one of the given emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me read the tweet carefully.

The tweet says, "I do not see how that is disgusting. She's cleaning herself and had a discharge, so what?" 

Hmm, the user is questioning why something is considered disgusting. They mention someone cleaning themselves and having a discharge. The use of "disgusting" in their statement suggests they're reacting to something others might find repulsive. However, the author says they don't see it that way, which could imply they're dismissing or are annoyed by others' opinions.

Looking at the emotion categories:

- Anger: This might fit if the tweet is showing frustration or annoyance.
- Disgust: The word "disgusting" is used, but the author doesn't agree, so it's more about their reaction to others' feelings of disgust.
- Fear: There's no indication of fear here.
- Joy: Definitely not, as the context is negative.
- Sadness: No sadness expressed.
- Surprise: Not really; they're questioning something.

I think the key emotion here is anger or annoyance because the author is dismissing someone else's view and perhaps feeling frustrated. They might be annoyed that others find it disgusting when they don't see it that way.

So, the most relevant emotion is **anger**.

**anger**

Okay, I'm trying to figure out the emotion conveyed in this tweet: "I do not see how that is disgusting. She's cleaning herself and had a discharge, so what?" 

First, let me break down the words used. The author starts by saying they don't understand why something is considered disgusting. Then they explain that someone was cleaning herself and had a discharge. The use of "disgusting" in the first part immediately makes me think of the emotion disgust. But I should check if other emotions might be applicable.

Looking at the tweet, it's a response to something perceived as disgusting. The author is dismissing that perception by pointing out the contextâ€”she was cleaning herself. This suggests they're not agreeing with the idea that it's disgusting, which could indicate frustration or perhaps a challenge. However, the primary emotion here seems to be disgust because the author is directly addressing and rejecting the notion of something being filthy or repulsive.

I should also consider if any other emotions fit. There's no clear indication of anger, as the tweet isn't expressing irritation towards someone else but rather questioning a judgment. Sadness or fear aren't present either. Joy and surprise don't seem applicable here because the context is about something being unclean. Therefore, disgust is the most fitting emotion category for this tweet.

The author is challenging the perception of something as disgusting by providing context, which primarily conveys **disgust**.

**disgust**
