Alright, I need to classify this tweet's emotion from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The tweet is: "Not really. Also it's Winnipeg, sorry we don't have the population of Tokyo..." 

First, let me understand the context. The person is saying that they're not something (maybe a city with high population), and then clarifies it's Winnipeg. They add an apology for not having Tokyo's population.

The tone here seems somewhat apologetic but not necessarily negative. It doesn't express anger or disgust. There's no fear, joy, or surprise either. The main emotion I pick up is sadness, possibly because they're pointing out a lack or expressing disappointment about not matching expectations, maybe feeling down about it.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion. The tweet says: "Not really. Also it’s Winnipeg, sorry we don’t have the population of Tokyo..." 

First, let me break down what's being said here. The author is responding to something with a negative or maybe a defensive tone. They mention Winnipeg and compare its population to Tokyo, which is much larger. The word "sorry" stands out—it doesn't sound like an apology for something they did, but more like an excuse or explanation. So the sentiment might be frustration or defensiveness.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger includes annoyance and rage, so maybe that's a fit. Disgust is more about dislike, but I don't sense hate here. Fear doesn't seem right because there's no indication of worry or anxiety. Joy? Definitely not; the tone isn't positive. Sadness could be possible if they're feeling down about it, but the way it's phrased sounds more like irritation than sadness. Surprise is about unexpected things, which isn't the case here.

So considering all that, I think anger makes sense because of the frustration in their response. They might be annoyed at being compared or maybe a bit defensive about Winnipeg's size.

Alright, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion into one of the six categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The tweet is: "Not really. Also it’s Winnipeg, sorry we don’t have the population of Tokyo..."

First, let me parse the content. The author is saying that Winnipeg doesn't have the population of Tokyo, which is a factually correct statement since Tokyo has a much larger population. But the tone here might be revealing the emotion.

Looking at "Not really." This could be a response to something else, maybe someone claiming something about Winnipeg's size or influence. The author is correcting them, so perhaps there's a hint of correction or maybe defensiveness.

Then they apologize for not having Tokyo's population, which adds a layer of self-deprecation or humility. Saying "sorry" might indicate some form of regret or acknowledgment of a shortcoming, but does that translate to any specific emotion?

I don't detect signs of anger here—no harsh words or frustration. Disgust? Not really, as it's more about factual information than something repulsive.

Fear? There doesn't seem to be any sense of anxiety or dread in the statement.

Joy isn't present either; this is more of a neutral or explanatory tweet.

Sadness could be a possibility because they're pointing out a deficiency. But "sorry" might not necessarily mean sadness—it could just be an apology for stating a fact.

Surprise? Maybe not, as it's a straightforward correction without any indication of astonishment.

Considering all this, the closest emotion might be sadness, especially if there's an undercurrent of disappointment or acknowledging a deficit. Alternatively, "sorry" could be neutral, but among the options given, sadness seems more fitting than others.
