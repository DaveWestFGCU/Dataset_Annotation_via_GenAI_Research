Alright, let's break down this tweet: "I don’t have a problem with diversity, I just wish it wasn’t so obvious." The user is saying they support diversity but find the emphasis on it too overt. The word "obvious" suggests that the author feels something is being shoved in their face or isn't subtle. This could indicate a sense of discomfort or mild annoyance. 

Looking at the emotion categories, I need to choose between anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise. Anger fits because the tweet might be expressing irritation or frustration with how diversity is being presented. Disgust usually relates more to something distasteful, which isn't exactly the case here. Fear would involve anxiety or terror, which doesn't apply. Joy and surprise are clearly not matching the tone. Sadness might involve grief or pensiveness, but the tweet seems more exasperated than sad.

So, considering all this, anger is the most appropriate emotion because the author is expressing frustration about diversity being too obvious, indicating some level of irritation or annoyance.

The tweet expresses mild frustration with the overt emphasis on diversity. The emotion conveyed here is **anger** as it reflects irritation or annoyance.

**anger**

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a tweet and wants me to classify the emotion conveyed by the author using specific categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully: "I don’t have a problem with diversity, I just wish it wasn’t so **obvious**." The bold word here is "obvious," which stands out. 

Next, I need to analyze the sentiment behind this statement. The author mentions not having a problem with diversity, which might suggest acceptance or positivity. However, they express a desire for it not being "obvious." This part is key because using the word "obvious" in a negative context could imply that the author finds it noticeable in a way they don't prefer.

Now, considering the emotion categories: anger isn't evident here unless there's frustration, but the tweet doesn't express overt irritation. Disgust involves dislike or aversion, which might fit if the author is expressing distaste towards something about diversity being too prominent. Fear and surprise don't seem applicable as there's no indication of worry or astonishment. Joy and sadness are also not clearly present.

So, focusing on disgust: The author doesn't have a problem with diversity itself but seems bothered by how it's presented or highlighted. This subtle expression of dislike fits within the disgust category, which includes disinterest or dislike.

Therefore, the emotion conveyed here is likely disgust.
