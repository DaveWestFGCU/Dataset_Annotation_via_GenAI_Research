Alright, so I need to classify this tweet into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The tweet says, "Each season gets better and better with season 3 or something you should go back and see what happened."

First, let's break down the words used here. The author is talking about each season getting better, especially highlighting that season 3 is particularly good. They're encouraging others to go back and see what happened, which suggests they want others to watch it too.

The key emotion here seems to be excitement or enthusiasm because they're praising the show and urging others to catch up. Excitement falls under joy since joy includes serenity, ecstasy, etc. There's no indication of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise in the tweet. It's all positive feedback about improvement and recommending content.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed is joy.

Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion is conveyed in this tweet: "Each season gets better and better with season 3 or something you should go back and see what happened." The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, let me read the tweet carefully. It says each season gets better with season 3, suggesting that there's improvement. Then it advises someone to "go back and see what happened," which implies revisiting something they might have missed before.

The tone seems positive because they mention each season getting better, especially highlighting season 3 as a peak. This positivity likely evokes joy or maybe even serenity since they're recommending others to enjoy the series.

I don't detect any signs of anger, like harsh words or complaints. There's no disgust expressed either; it's more about appreciation. Fear and sadness are also absentâ€”it doesn't sound worried or somber. Surprise might be a stretch unless someone finds something unexpected, but the overall sentiment is clearly positive.

So, putting it all together, the emotion here seems to be joy because they're expressing enthusiasm about the series getting better and encouraging others to experience it.
