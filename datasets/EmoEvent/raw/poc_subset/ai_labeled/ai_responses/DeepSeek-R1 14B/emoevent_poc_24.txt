Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify this tweet's emotion. The tweet is: "I'm so glad I watched this entire thing. That's incredible." 

First, I need to analyze the words used. The user says they're "glad," which immediately makes me think of happiness or joy. They also mention it being "incredible," which adds to that positive feeling. 

Looking at the emotion categories provided: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet doesn't show any signs of negative emotions like anger or sadness. It's not expressing fear or disgust either. Surprise could be a possibility if they were taken aback by something unexpected, but "glad" and "incredible" lean more towards positive feelings.

So, the emotion here is definitely joy because of words like "glad" and "incredible." There's no indication of surprise beyond the excitement that comes with joy.

Okay, let's tackle this classification task step by step. The tweet in question is: "I’m so glad I watched this entire thing. That’s incredible." 

First, I'll read the tweet carefully to understand the sentiment being expressed. The author starts with expressing relief or satisfaction ("so glad") and then uses an exclamation of amazement ("That's incredible"). These words indicate a positive emotion.

Next, I'll refer back to the list of emotions provided: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to determine which one fits best based on the tweet.

The word "glad" suggests happiness or satisfaction, which falls under "joy." The term "incredible" adds emphasis and conveys a sense of awe, which also aligns with positive emotions, reinforcing that it's about joy rather than surprise. 

I should consider if any other emotion might fit better. There are no signs of anger, disgust, fear, or sadness here. Surprise could be a contender because "incredible" sometimes expresses astonishment, but the overall tone is more about happiness and satisfaction.

Therefore, the most relevant emotion from the list is joy.
