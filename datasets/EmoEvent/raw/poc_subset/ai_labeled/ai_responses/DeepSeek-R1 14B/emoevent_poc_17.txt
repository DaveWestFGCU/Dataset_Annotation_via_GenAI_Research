Alright, so I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion it conveys. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Let me read the tweet again: "Thank you, I love Heart and Zeppelin and haven't seen that till now." 

The user is thanking someone, which usually indicates a positive feeling. They mention loving two things: Heart and Zeppelin. Since both are presumably bands or something they enjoy, this suggests happiness or contentment.

The last part says they haven't seen "that" till now. If "that" refers to whatever was being discussed before their comment, maybe it's something new or exciting that they're happy about discovering.

So putting it together: gratitude expressed with love for these things and a positive reaction to seeing them now. All of this points towards joy.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a tweet: "Thank you, I love Heart and Zeppelin and haven't seen that till now." They want me to classify the emotion conveyed in this tweet from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. The author is thanking someone, expressing love for "Heart and Zeppelin," which are likely bands or artists. Then they mention not having seen something until now, which suggests it's a positive experience they've discovered recently.

The sentiment here seems clearly positive. Words like "love" indicate joy. There's no sign of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise in the message. It's straightforward gratitude and appreciation.

I should consider if there's any possibility of another emotion. Could "haven't seen that till now" imply surprise? Maybe a bit, but the primary emotion is definitely joy because of the expression of love and gratitude. Surprise would be more about an unexpected event, which isn't clearly stated here.

So, the most relevant emotion is joy.

Alright, so I need to classify this tweet into one of the given emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me read the tweet again carefully.

The tweet says, "Thank you, I love Heart and Zeppelin and haven't seen that till now." Breaking it down, the author is thanking someone, which immediately makes me think of positive emotions. The mention of loving "Heart and Zeppelin" suggests they're expressing fondness or enjoyment towards those thingsâ€”maybe bands? That definitely points to a positive emotion.

Next part: "haven't seen that till now." This could mean they saw something new they love, like maybe a performance or content featuring these artists. The excitement or satisfaction of discovering something new might add another layer.

Looking at the emotion categories:

- Anger/annoyance/rage: Doesn't fit here; there's no indication of frustration or irritation.
- Disgust/disinterest/dislike: Again, no signs of negative feelings towards anything mentioned.
- Fear/apprehension/anxiety: The tweet doesn't express any fear or worry.
- Joy/serenity/ecstasy: This seems spot on. The user is expressing gratitude and love, which are clear indicators of joy.
- Sadness/pensiveness/grief: No sadness or gloomy tone in the message.
- Surprise/distraction/amazement: While surprise could be possible if "that" refers to something unexpected, the overall sentiment leans more towards positive feelings rather than shock.

Putting it all together, the main emotion conveyed is joy. The user is happy and grateful, showing love for something they've discovered or experienced, which aligns with the 'joy' category.
