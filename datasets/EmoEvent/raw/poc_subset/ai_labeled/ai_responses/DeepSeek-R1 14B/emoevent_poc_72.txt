Okay, I need to classify the emotion in the tweet: "Here’s hoping this ends soon lol". Let me break it down.

First, the words used are "hoping" and "ends soon", which suggest that something is not ideal and they're hoping for its conclusion. That could imply a negative emotion like sadness or maybe even frustration, which is part of anger.

Then there's the "lol" at the end. This typically indicates humor, light-heartedness, or trying to keep things positive despite the situation. So while the initial part might hint at something not great, the laughter adds a layer of positivity or acceptance.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger involves annoyance or rage; disgust is more about dislike; fear relates to anxiety; joy and serenity are positive; sadness includes pensiveness; surprise is about unexpected events.

The tweet seems to express a desire for an end to something, possibly indicating some level of discomfort (which could be sadness). However, the "lol" suggests they're coping with it humorously, maybe not feeling intense anger or disgust. There's no fear, joy, or surprise evident here. 

So the primary emotion is likely sadness because they're hoping for an end, but the tone isn't overtly negative without the humor. But considering the list and the options, I think it leans more towards sadness rather than something like fear or anger.

Okay, so I need to classify the emotion in the tweet: "Here’s hoping this ends soon lol". Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the text. The user is expressing a hope that something ends soon. The word "hope" suggests they're wishing for an end to a situation, which might be negative or uncomfortable. Then there's "lol" added, which usually indicates laughter or something positive, but in this context, it could mean they're trying to cope with the situation humorously.

So, the main emotion here seems mixed. On one hand, hoping something ends soon implies some level of discomfort or maybe even mild frustration—could that be anger? But wait, anger is more about intense feelings like annoyance or rage. Is this more about being annoyed or just wanting an end to something?

Alternatively, could it be sadness? If they're hoping for the end of a negative experience, maybe they're feeling down about it. But I don't see overtly sad language here.

The "lol" makes me think they might not want to express too much negativity. Maybe they're trying to keep a positive spin on things by adding humor. So is there an element of joy or serenity? Not exactly, because the hope is for something negative to end, which doesn't directly tie into joy.

Looking at surprise—would that fit? No, surprise is more about unexpected events, and this isn't really expressing that.

Disgust could be a stretch if they're disgusted by the situation, but the tone here feels more hopeful than disgusted. Fear? Maybe if the situation they're hoping to end is something scary or anxiety-inducing, but again, it's not explicitly stated.

So breaking it down: "hoping this ends soon" indicates some negative sentiment—annoyance or frustration perhaps. But since they added "lol," it might be a way of coping without getting too intense about the emotion.

But in terms of the categories given, the closest fit would likely be sadness because they're hoping for an end to something that's causing them discomfort, which could stem from feeling down or upset about it. Alternatively, maybe it's closer to anger if there's frustration involved.

Wait, but "anger" includes annoyance and rage, so if the situation is annoying them, then anger might fit better than sadness. But I'm not sure if hoping for an end translates more directly to frustration (a subset of anger) or to sadness because they're in a bad state that needs to end.

I think it's more about frustration—hoping something ends soon suggests it's currently ongoing and bothersome, which would lean towards anger or its subsets. But since the user added "lol," maybe they're not feeling outright angry but rather mildly annoyed or frustrated, which still falls under anger.

Alternatively, could it be surprise? Maybe not. The emotion seems more about a desire to end something negative rather than being surprised by an event.

So considering all this, I'd say the emotion is sadness because they're expressing a wish for an end to a negative situation, indicating they might be feeling down or upset.

The tweet expresses a wish for the end of a negative situation and includes humor. The most fitting emotion from the list is **sadness**, as it reflects the desire for an end to something discomforting.

**sadness**

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet: "Here’s hoping this ends soon lol" into one of the emotions listed: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the text itself, the user is expressing a hope that something ends soon, followed by "lol," which stands for laugh out loud. The phrase "Here’s hoping this ends soon" suggests they're in a situation they want to conclude quickly, possibly because it's not enjoyable or pleasant. The use of "lol" might indicate that they're trying to lighten the mood or express some form of reaction.

I should consider each emotion category:

- Anger: This would involve irritation or rage. While the user is hoping something ends, there's no direct expression of anger here.
- Disgust: This involves dislike or disinterest. The tweet doesn't explicitly show disgust towards someone or something.
- Fear: Apprehension or anxiety might be involved if they're worried about what's happening, but again, not directly stated.
- Joy: Serenity or ecstasy isn't evident; instead, the user seems to want an end to a situation.
- Sadness: This includes pensiveness or grief. The hope for something ending could imply that the current state is unpleasant, which might relate to sadness.
- Surprise: Distraction or amazement isn't clearly present here.

The "lol" adds a layer of complexity. It's often used to express amusement or to downplay the severity of a situation. So the user might be feeling sad about the situation but using humor as a coping mechanism. Therefore, while there's an element of positivity with "lol," the primary emotion seems to stem from the desire for the situation to end, which points more towards sadness.

I think the best fit is **sadness** because they're hoping something ends, indicating that it's not a positive experience for them right now.
