Alright, let's tackle this tweet classification task. The user wants me to determine the emotion conveyed by the author based on the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

Looking at the tweet: "Great game, great soundtrack. He was like 19 or 20 when he did that too." 

First, I notice the words "great" are used twice, which immediately makes me think of positivity. That's a strong indicator of joy. The user is expressing satisfaction with both the game and the soundtrack.

The second part mentions the age of the person involved, but it's more of an additional information rather than an emotional statement. It doesn't seem to carry any negative connotation or surprise; it's just stating facts about when something was done.

Considering the emotion categories, joy seems to fit best here because of the enthusiastic praise. There's no sign of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise in the tweet.

Alright, let's tackle this tweet classification task. So, the user provided a tweet: "Great game, great soundtrack. He was like 19 or 20 when he did that too." They want me to classify it into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read through the tweet carefully. The first part says "Great game, great soundtrack." That definitely sounds positive. Using words like "great" twice emphasizes approval and satisfaction. So right there, that's a strong indicator of joy because the person is expressing happiness about something they enjoyed.

Next, the second sentence adds more context: "He was like 19 or 20 when he did that too." This seems to be providing additional information about someone who created something impressive at a young age. It's admiration mixed with maybe a bit of surprise because achieving such success so early is commendable and unexpected.

Looking at the emotion categories, joy fits well here because of the positive words used. Surprise could also be considered, especially regarding the person's age. However, the primary emotion conveyed in the first part of the tweet is clearly joy. The mention of age adds to the overall sentiment but doesn't change the main emotion.

I should make sure not to mix up the emotions. Even though surprise is present, it's secondary to the predominant feeling of happiness and approval. So, sticking with joy as the primary emotion makes sense.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The tweet says, "Great game, great soundtrack. He was like 19 or 20 when he did that too." 

First, let's break down the words and tone. The user starts with "Great game, great soundtrack," which immediately sounds positive. Using "great" twice emphasizes their satisfaction. This makes me think of joy because they're expressing happiness about both the game and its music.

The second part mentions someone who was 19 or 20 when they did something impressive. That adds context but doesn't change the overall tone. It's just additional information that might show appreciation for the person's talent at a young age, which still aligns with positive feelings.

Looking at other emotions: there's no sign of anger, so not anger. Disgust or disinterest isn't present either; they're clearly enjoying it. Fear or anxiety? No, the tweet is all praise. Sadness doesn't fit because they're expressing positive sentiments. Surprise could be considered if something unexpected happened, but here it's more about appreciation rather than surprise.

So, considering all this, the emotion conveyed is joy.
