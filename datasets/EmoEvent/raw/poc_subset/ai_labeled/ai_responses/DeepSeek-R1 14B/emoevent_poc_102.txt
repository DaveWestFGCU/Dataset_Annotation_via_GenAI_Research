Okay, so I need to classify this tweet: "don't we all hate them?" into one of the given emotion categories. Let me think through this step by step.

First, looking at the words used. The main verb here is "hate," which immediately makes me think of negative emotions. But I should check what each category includes.

The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Anger is also associated with annoyance and rage, so that's a broad category. Dislike is part of disgust, but the tweet specifically says "hate," which might be more intense than just dislike. Fear involves anxiety or terror, which doesn't seem to fit here because the emotion expressed isn't about fear.

Joy is obviously positive, so that's out. Sadness includes grief and pensiveness; while hate can sometimes lead to sadness, the direct expression here is about hating, not necessarily feeling sad. Surprise is about being amazed or distracted, which also doesn't apply here.

So "hate" falls under anger because it's an expression of strong dislike or irritation. Therefore, the emotion conveyed in this tweet is likely **anger**.
</think>

The tweet expresses a strong negative emotion towards something or someone, using the word "hate." Since hate is a form of intense dislike and falls under the category of anger, which includes annoyances and rage.

**Answer:** **anger**

Alright, I need to classify this tweet's emotion. The tweet says, "don't we all hate them?" 

First, let me break down the words used. The word "hate" is a strong indicator of negative emotion. It falls under anger because it expresses intense dislike or irritation. 

Looking at the context, the speaker is addressing a group with "we all," suggesting a collective feeling against someone or something. This collective expression reinforces the intensity of the emotion.

I should consider other possible emotions too. Could it be disgust? Disgust usually involves feelings of aversion towards something unpleasant, but "hate" is more about anger and irritation. Fear? Not really, because there's no sense of threat here. Sadness or surprise? No, those don't fit the tone either.

So, focusing on "hate," it's clear that the emotion intended is anger.
</think>

The tweet uses the word "hate," which directly indicates a feeling of anger or annoyance towards something or someone. The speaker is expressing frustration or irritation, fitting within the category of anger.

**anger**

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what emotion is behind this tweet: "don't we all hate them?" The user wants me to classify it into one of these emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Okay, let's break this down.

First, the sentence starts with "don't we all..." which sounds like a rhetorical question. It's trying to get others to agree or relate. The word "hate" is clearly negative, so that points towards one of the negative emotions on the list. 

Now, looking at the options: anger includes annoyance and rage. Disgust includes disinterest and dislike. So, does "hate" fall under anger or disgust? Well, hate can be a strong emotion, but in this context, it's more about directing frustration towards something or someone, which aligns with anger rather than disgust.

The tweet is prompting others to express agreement, which suggests the author is feeling angry and wants collective outrage. It doesn't seem like fear because there's no indication of worry or terror. Sadness isn't really here; it's more about a negative action rather than sorrow. Surprise? No, because there's nothing unexpected being stated.

So, considering all that, I think anger is the emotion conveyed here. The use of "hate" and the rhetorical question aiming for agreement are both indicative of someone feeling angry.

**anger**
