Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a tweet: "You're mean." They want me to classify the emotion conveyed here from a specific list.

First, I'll break down the phrase. "You're mean" is a direct statement that implies someone is being unkind or harsh. Now, looking at the emotion categories: anger includes annoyance and rage; disgust covers disinterest and dislike; fear involves apprehension and anxiety; joy includes serenity and ecstasy; sadness encompasses pensiveness and grief; surprise includes distraction and amazement.

So, "You're mean" likely conveys negative emotions. It's not disgust because that usually relates more to feelings about something being unpleasant rather than a direct accusation. Fear doesn't seem right here since the tweet isn't indicating threat or danger. Sadness might be involved if someone feels hurt, but the primary emotion here is more irritation.

Therefore, "You're mean" probably expresses anger, as it's a reproach towards someone's behavior that's perceived as unkind. It's not about being surprised or feeling sad; it's about the frustration or annoyance directed at another person.

Okay, so I need to classify the tweet "You're mean" into one of the given emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the phrase is addressing someone as mean. The word "mean" here likely refers to being unkind or harsh rather than indicating something clever or in a good way. So, the speaker is calling out the other person for their behavior.

Now, considering the emotion categories:

- **Anger**: This includes annoyance and rage. When someone calls another person mean, it could be because they're upset or annoyed with them. That fits into anger.
  
- **Disgust**: This involves disinterest or dislike. While "mean" can express dislike, the immediate reaction is more about being upset rather than feeling disgusted.

- **Fear**: I don't think fear is relevant here. There's no indication of apprehension or anxiety in this statement.

- **Joy, Sadness, Surprise**: These seem unrelated. The tweet isn't expressing happiness, sorrow, or amazement.

So, the most fitting emotion is anger because calling someone "mean" usually stems from frustration or annoyance.

Okay, I need to classify the tweet "You’re mean" into one of the given emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll analyze the content of the tweet. The word "mean" here is a strong negative adjective that implies someone is unkind or harsh. This usually conveys a feeling of dislike or irritation towards another person. 

Next, looking at the emotion categories provided: anger includes annoyance and rage, which seems fitting because calling someone mean can be seen as expressing frustration or irritation. Disgust involves feelings like disinterest or dislike, but "mean" is more about behavior rather than something revolting. Fear is related to anxiety or terror, which doesn't quite fit here. Joy and surprise are positive emotions that don't align with the negative tone of the tweet.

Considering all options, anger seems most appropriate because it encapsulates the irritation or annoyance someone might feel when addressing another person as mean.

The emotion conveyed in "You’re mean" is likely **anger**, as it reflects frustration or irritation towards someone's behavior. 

**Answer:** **anger**
