Alright, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion: "Then I find writing of us only eating it during winter strange." The user provided a list of emotions to choose from: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the tweet is about finding something strange. The author is expressing that they think it's odd or unusual that "us" only eat something during winter. The word "strange" directly points to a feeling of surprise because the speaker is taken aback or finds something unexpected.

Looking at the emotion categories, surprise is one of them and it includes feelings like amazement or being distracted by something unexpected. Since the tweet uses the word "strange," which implies surprise, that's the primary emotion here.

I should consider other emotions to make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any hint of anger? The speaker seems more puzzled than angry. Disgust? Not really; it's more about finding something unusual rather than dislike. Fear or anxiety? No, nothing suggests fear. Joy? The tweet doesn't express happiness or serenity. Sadness? There's no indication of grief or pensiveness.

Therefore, the emotion conveyed is surprise because the speaker finds the situation strange, indicating an unexpected twist that catches their attention.

Okay, so I'm trying to classify the emotion in this tweet: "Then I find writing of us only eating it during winter strange." Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, the author is talking about finding something strange. The word "strange" usually relates to surprise or being amazed. But wait, could there be another emotion involved?

Looking at the options: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Since they mention it as strange, that points towards surprise. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or disgust. The context is about a habit during winter, so maybe it's not fear or sadness.

I don't think it's joy because the tone doesn't seem positive. So yeah, "strange" fits best under surprise.

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion is conveyed in this tweet: "Then I find writing of us only eating it during winter strange." Alright, let me break it down.

First, the author mentions finding something strange. The word "strange" usually relates to surprise or astonishment. They're expressing that they find a certain practice (eating something only during winter) unusual, which implies they weren't expecting this and it caught their attention in a surprising way.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. "Strange" doesn't fit into anger because there's no indication of frustration or rage. Disgust is about disliking something, but here it's more about finding something unexpected rather than dislike. Fear would involve worry or anxiety, which isn't present here. Joy and serenity don't seem right either since the tweet isn't expressing happiness. That leaves surprise, which perfectly captures the feeling of something being unusual or unexpected.

So, the emotion is surprise.
