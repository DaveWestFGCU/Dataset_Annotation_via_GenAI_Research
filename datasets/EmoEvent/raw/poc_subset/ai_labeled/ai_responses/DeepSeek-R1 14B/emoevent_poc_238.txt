Okay, so I need to classify this tweet: "That was glorious." Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should understand what each emotion category entails. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise. So the tweet has to fit into one of these six categories based on the author's intended emotion.

The phrase in question is "That was glorious." Glorious typically means something very impressive or extremely good. So it's a positive statement, right? It sounds like the speaker is expressing satisfaction or pleasure about something that happened.

Looking at the emotion categories: Joy includes serenity and ecstasy, which are all positive feelings. So when someone says something was glorious, they're likely feeling joy. I don't think it's surprise because "glorious" doesn't suggest anything unexpected or astonishing, just something very positive. It's not fear, anger, disgust, or sadnessâ€”those are all negative emotions.

So putting it together, the tweet is expressing a positive emotion, which aligns with joy. Therefore, the classification should be joy.

Okay, so I need to classify the tweet "That was glorious." into one of the given emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me break this down.

First, I'll look at the word "glorious." It's an adjective that typically has a positive connotation. The word "glorious" often relates to something very good, impressive, or extremely enjoyable. So right off the bat, this seems like it's expressing a positive emotion.

Now, considering the emotion categories provided: anger is about negative feelings like annoyance or rage; disgust is about dislike or disinterest; fear involves anxiety or terror; sadness includes grief or pensiveness; surprise covers amazement or distraction. The only category left that fits a positive emotion is joy, which also encompasses serenity and ecstasy.

So "glorious" seems to fit into the joy category because it's expressing something extremely positive and pleasing. There's no indication of any negative emotions here, so I can rule out anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise. 

Wait, could it be surprise? Sometimes, 'glorious' might be used in a surprising context, but more often than not, it's about positivity. So joy feels like the best fit.

Therefore, the emotion conveyed is joy.
