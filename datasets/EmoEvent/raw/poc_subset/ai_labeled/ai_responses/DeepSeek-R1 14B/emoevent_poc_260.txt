Okay, so I need to classify this tweet into one of the given emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me look at the tweet again: "Can't wait till the home game in March... And a portland okc playoff series would be 'lit af'". 

Alright, breaking it down, the user is expressing excitement about an upcoming home game and a potential playoff series between Portland and Oklahoma City. They're using the term "lit af," which I know stands for "lighting it up" in slang, often used to express something being really good or exciting.

So first, let's analyze each emotion category:

1. **Anger**: The tweet doesn't show any signs of frustration or irritation. Instead, it's positive.
2. **Disgust**: There's nothing here that would indicate dislike or disinterest. It's all about looking forward to something.
3. **Fear**: No mention of worry or anxiety; the tone is upbeat.
4. **Joy**: This seems promising because they're expressing excitement and eagerness for an event. The use of "Can't wait" and "lit af" both indicate positive emotions.
5. **Sadness**: There's no indication of grief or pensiveness here.
6. **Surprise**: While surprise can sometimes overlap with excitement, the tweet isn't about being unexpectedly happy but rather looking forward to something expected.

The key phrases are "Can't wait" and "'lit af'". These clearly indicate a positive, excited emotion. There's no nuance suggesting any other emotion except joy. They're anticipating an event they find exciting, which fits under joy.

Okay, I need to classify this tweet's emotion. The tweet says, "Can't wait till the home game in March... And a portland okc playoff series would be 'lit af'". Let me break it down.

First, "Can't wait" shows excitement or eagerness. Then, "home game in March" indicates looking forward to something positive. Using "would be 'lit af'"—'lit' means exciting or cool, and 'af' is slang for 'as f***', so overall, the speaker is expressing enthusiasm.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger isn't here, disgust either. Fear? No, it's about looking forward. Sadness? Definitely not. Surprise? Maybe, but it's more about excitement. Joy fits because they're eagerly anticipating a fun event. So I think joy is the right category.
