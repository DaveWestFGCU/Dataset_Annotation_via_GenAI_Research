Alright, let's figure out what emotion this tweet is conveying. The tweet says: "The myth is about selling shirts. Signing [NAME] opens up much more money making opportunities like commercials." 

First, I need to analyze the content. It mentions a business opportunity related to selling shirts and signing a name that leads to more money-making chances, specifically through commercials. This seems positive because it's talking about increased revenue or success.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tone here is upbeat, highlighting new opportunities and growth. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or fear. It doesn't seem to be a neutral or surprising statement either; it's more about excitement.

So, the emotion that fits best is joy because the author is sharing good news about expanding their business opportunities, which would naturally bring happiness or satisfaction.

First, let me read it carefully. It mentions that signing someone (maybe a company or person) leads to more money-making opportunities beyond just selling shirts, specifically mentioning commercials.

Hmm, the emotions I can choose from are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The author is talking about increased income and new business opportunities. That sounds positive.

When people talk about expanding their revenue streams and getting into things like commercials, it's usually because they're excited or happy about the prospects. So the emotion here would likely be joy because of the positive implications for their earnings and career growth.
