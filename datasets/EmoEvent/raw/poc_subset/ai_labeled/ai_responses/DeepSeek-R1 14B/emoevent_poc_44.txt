Alright, I need to classify this tweet's emotion based on the given list. Let me read the tweet again: "Also you forget to say how it triggers an Id check which only a assistant can circumvent." 

Hmm, the tone here seems critical or annoyed. The author is pointing out something they think was overlooked and mention that it's only an assistant who can handle it. That suggests frustration, maybe some irritation.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger includes annoyance and rage. Disgust is more about dislike or disinterest, but this doesn't seem like that. Fear would involve anxiety or apprehension, which isn't clearly present here. Joy is obviously not fitting. Sadness is about grief or pensiveness, which also doesn't match. Surprise is more about amazement or distraction.

So the emotion here is likely anger because of the critical and annoyed tone.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to classify a tweet based on the emotion conveyed from a specific list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully: "Also you forget to say how it triggers an Id check which only a assistant can circumvent." 

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. The author is pointing out something that was missed—specifically mentioning an Id check and how an assistant can bypass it. They're not using any overtly emotional words here.

I need to consider the emotion categories. Anger involves annoyance or rage, which might come through if someone feels frustrated. Disgust includes dislike or disinterest; I don't see that here. Fear would involve apprehension or anxiety—doesn't seem to fit. Joy and surprise are positive emotions, so unlikely in this context.

Looking at the tweet again, the tone doesn't feel particularly angry or any other negative emotion. It's more of a correction or reminder. Maybe the author is frustrated because they're pointing out an oversight, but frustration can sometimes be considered under anger. However, the statement is more factual than emotional.

I think the key here is that there's no explicit emotion expressed. The tweet is informative rather than conveying feelings. Therefore, the most appropriate classification would be neutral or not clearly expressing any of the given emotions.

But wait, the user wants me to pick one from the list, so maybe they expect an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the mention of forgetting something could hint at mild frustration, which is under anger. But since there's no strong indication of emotion, it might be safer to go with neutral if allowed.

However, the user specified only the given categories. Since none fit perfectly, maybe 'anger' is the closest stretch due to potential oversight frustration. Alternatively, perhaps the tweet doesn't express any clear emotion and should be labeled as such, but since that's not an option here, I have to choose one.

Wait, the original response was "surprise." Let me reconsider. Is there anything surprising in the tweet? The statement seems like a reminder rather than something unexpected. So 'surprise' doesn't fit either.

I think the best approach is to note that the emotion isn't clearly expressed and perhaps state it as neutral or not applicable, but since I have to choose from the list, maybe 'anger' due to mild frustration about forgetting, but honestly, it's more of a factual statement.

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion is conveyed in this tweet: "Also you forget to say how it triggers an Id check which only a assistant can circumvent." The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, let me read the tweet carefully. It seems like someone is pointing out that another person forgot to mention something about an ID check being triggered by an assistant. They're correcting or reminding them about this point.

Hmm, what emotion does that convey? Well, when someone corrects someone else or points out a mistake, it can sometimes show frustration or irritation. That's part of the anger category, which also includes annoyance and rage. So maybe the author is feeling annoyed because they think the other person overlooked an important detail.

But wait, could it be something else? Let me check the other options. Disgust usually involves dislike or aversion, but I don't see a clear expression of that here. Fear would imply anxiety or apprehension, which doesn't seem to fit. Joy is about happiness, which isn't present. Sadness would involve grief or pensiveness, which also doesn't apply. Surprise is more about being amazed or distracted, but this seems more corrective than surprising.

So the most fitting emotion from the list is anger because the tweet comes across as a correction, possibly with some frustration.
</think>

The tweet conveys **anger** because it corrects someone else, suggesting frustration or annoyance at an oversight. 

**Answer:** **anger**
