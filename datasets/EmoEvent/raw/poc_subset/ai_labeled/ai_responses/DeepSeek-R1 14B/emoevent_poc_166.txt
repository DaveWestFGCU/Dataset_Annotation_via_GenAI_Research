Alright, so I have this tweet: "It would be a crime to not invite him." And I need to classify it based on emotion from the given list. Let's break this down.

First, let me understand the sentence. The author is saying that not inviting someone would be a crime. That sounds pretty strong. Using "crime" indicates something severe or wrong.

Now, considering the emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

Anger often involves frustration or irritation. But does this tweet show that? It's more about the consequence of an action rather than personal frustration.

Disgust is more about dislike or revulsion. The tweet doesn't express hate but talks about consequences.

Fear involves anxiety or apprehension. Maybe if someone feels scared about the repercussions, but here it's phrased as a crime, which is a serious accusation.

Joy and sadness are not present here because the statement isn't positive or sad; it's more about judgment.

Surprise? The tweet doesn't express amazement or unexpectedness.

So the emotion here seems to be anger. The author is expressing strong disapproval or irritation that someone wasn't invited, using "crime" to emphasize the severity. It's a way of showing frustration or annoyance at the situation.

Okay, so I need to classify the tweet "It would be a crime to not invite him." based on the emotions listed. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the sentence. The author is saying that not inviting someone would be a crime. That sounds pretty strong. Using the word "crime" implies that it's a serious omission or mistake. 

Now, looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to figure out which one fits best.

Anger is about irritation or rage. The tweet doesn't express personal frustration but rather points out an action as wrong. Maybe not anger then.

Disgust involves dislike or disapproval. If the author were disgusted, they might be showing contempt for someone's actions, but here it's more about a moral judgment.

Fear is related to anxiety or apprehension. I don't think fear is present here; it's more of a statement rather than expressing worry.

Joy and surprise are positive emotions, which don't seem applicable here since the tweet is critical.

That leaves us with surprise. But wait, surprise isn't exactly about criticism. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me rethink.

Alternatively, could it be anger? Because calling something a crime might indicate strong disapproval, which can stem from anger. So maybe anger is more appropriate than surprise here.

Wait, but the emotion should be what the author intended to convey. If they're labeling an action as a crime, it's more of a statement about the severity rather than expressing personal emotion like anger or surprise.

Hmm, perhaps I need to consider that "it would be a crime" is a strong statement but doesn't necessarily express an emotion directly. Since all options are emotions, maybe the closest fit is anger because they're expressing disapproval or outrage.

But actually, upon reflection, using "crime" might not necessarily convey an emotional state but rather a judgment. However, among the given options, I think surprise isn't the best fit here. Maybe it's more about conveying that not inviting him is a significant oversight, which could be seen as surprising in a negative way, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that the tweet is making a strong statement of disapproval, which aligns with anger or maybe disgust. But I think the primary emotion here is expressing that not inviting someone is morally wrong, which might lean towards anger because of the strong language used ("crime"). So I'll go with anger as the intended emotion.

Alright, so I need to figure out what emotion is conveyed in this tweet: "It would be a crime to not invite him." The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. 

First, let me parse the sentence. The author is saying that not inviting someone would be a crime, which implies it's something serious and wrong. The word "crime" suggests wrongdoing or moral failing. So the author is expressing disapproval or strong negative feelings about the idea of not inviting him.

Now, looking at the emotion categories: anger includes annoyance and rage, disgust includes dislike and disinterest, fear involves anxiety or terror, joy is positive, sadness is about grief or pensiveness, and surprise relates to amazement or distraction.

In this case, the author isn't expressing fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The strong negative implication points more towards anger or disgust. Disgust usually pertains to feeling something is unpleasant or wrong on a moral level, which fits here because calling it a crime implies a moral judgment. Alternatively, anger could also fit since it's a negative emotion, but the use of "crime" might lean more towards disgust as it's about disapproving or finding something morally wrong.

So between anger and disgust, I think disgust is more appropriate because it's about the act being wrong rather than personal irritation.
