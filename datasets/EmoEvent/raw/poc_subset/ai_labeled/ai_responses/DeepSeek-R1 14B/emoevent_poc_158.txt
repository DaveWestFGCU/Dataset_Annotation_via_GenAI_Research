Alright, I need to classify this tweet's emotion using only the specified categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The tweet says, "My 2 year old loves Word Party. Story Bots is another good Netflix option." 

First, looking at the content, it's about a parent talking positively about two Netflix shows for kids—Word Party and Story Bots. They seem to be sharing information in a positive light.

The emotions listed don't include happiness directly, but joy includes serenity and ecstasy, which are positive feelings. The author is expressing satisfaction or approval of the content their child enjoys, so it's likely they're feeling happy about finding good shows.

No other emotions like anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise come into play here. There's no indication of any negative feelings; instead, it's a neutral yet positive statement. However, since joy is one of the categories and fits as a positive sentiment, I'll go with that.

Alright, let's see. I need to classify this tweet into one of the given emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

The tweet says, "My 2 year old loves Word Party. Story Bots is another good Netflix option." So, the person is talking about their child enjoying a show and suggesting another one.

First, I'll break it down. The author mentions that their two-year-old loves "Word Party," which seems like a positive statement. They're highlighting something they enjoy. Then, they recommend "Story Bots" as another good option on Netflix. This sounds supportive and enthusiastic about these shows.

Looking at the emotions: anger is out because there's no sign of irritation or rage. Disgust isn't here either; they don't express dislike or disinterest. Fear or anxiety doesn't come into play in this context. Sadness isn't present—it's a positive statement without any negative feelings.

Now, joy fits well here. The author is sharing something they find enjoyable and helpful for their child. It's a happy sentiment about finding good content that the child likes. There's also an element of excitement or satisfaction in recommending another show.

Surprise might be considered if there was something unexpected, but this seems more like a straightforward positive recommendation without any shock factor.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed is joy.
