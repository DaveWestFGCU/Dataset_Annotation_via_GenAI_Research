Okay, I need to classify this tweet into one of the given emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The tweet is: "Depay being a flop at United comes to mind, so good now."

First, let's break down the content. It mentions Depay, who was a flop at United, but then says "so good now." So, it seems like the author is pointing out that despite past underperformance (being a flop), Depay has turned things around and is performing well.

The emotion here isn't overtly positive or negative but more of an observation. However, when someone points out that someone improved from being bad to good, it can carry a sense of satisfaction or approval. That might lean towards joy because the author seems pleased about the improvement.

Alternatively, could there be any elements of surprise? Maybe not as much because it's more of a statement than an unexpected event. Joy seems more fitting because of the positive outcome.

So, considering all that, I think the emotion is joy.

Alright, let me try to figure out what emotion this tweet is conveying. The tweet says, "Depay being a flop at United comes to mind, so good now." Hmm, okay.

First, I need to understand the context here. Depay is a footballer who joined Manchester United, and apparently, he's not performing well (hence "flop"). But then it says "so good now," which might mean that despite being a flop before, he's becoming good again or that people are starting to see him in a better light.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Let me break it down. The first part mentions Depay being a flop, which could imply criticism or disappointment. But then it switches to "so good now," indicating improvement. 

Is there any indication of strong emotions like anger or disgust? Not really. It's more about the change in his performance—going from bad to good. That feels positive, but not overly joyful. Maybe joy? Because seeing someone improve could bring happiness.

Alternatively, surprise is another option because it's unexpected that he's turning things around. But I think joy fits better here since it's a positive shift in his career.

Alright, let me try to figure out what emotion is behind this tweet: "Depay being a flop at United comes to mind, so good now." Okay, first I'll break down the sentence.

"Depay being a flop at United" – that part sounds negative. Depay is probably not doing well at his current team, Manchester United, and the word "flop" definitely has a negative connotation. So that's pointing towards something like anger or maybe disappointment.

Then it says, "comes to mind." Hmm, so this thought about Depay being a flop is lingering in their mind, which could indicate some frustration or maybe even irritation. That still falls under the umbrella of anger since those are related emotions.

Next part: "so good now." Wait, that's interesting because "good" is positive. Maybe the author is contrasting his current performance with past expectations. Perhaps they're surprised that he's performing well again after being a flop. Or maybe they're relieved or happy about his improvement.

Putting it all together, the tweet starts by mentioning Depay's failure ("flop") and then ends on a positive note about him being good now. The shift from negative to positive might indicate surprise because of the unexpected turn-around in performance. Alternatively, it could be joy if they're genuinely happy for him, but given that the first part is negative and the second is positive, I'm leaning more towards surprise.

Another angle: sometimes when people mention contrasting thoughts or sudden changes, they express surprise. So the author might be surprised that Depay is now performing well again after being a flop earlier.

I should also consider if there's any indication of other emotions like disgust or fear, but the words don't really point to those. It's more about the unexpected positive outcome rather than dislike or fear.

So weighing all this, I think the emotion conveyed here is surprise because of the shift from negative to positive and the implication that it wasn't expected.

The tweet contrasts Depay's previous underperformance ("flop") with his current improvement ("so good now"). This juxtaposition of negative and positive suggests an unexpected turn-around, which aligns with the emotion of **surprise**.

**surprise**
