Alright, I need to classify this tweet's emotion. The text is about ISIS members ordering a book called "[RELIGION] for dummies." Hmm, so the author is recalling an event where ISIS members bought such a book. 

First, let me consider the emotions listed: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

The situation involves ISIS, which is associated with negative feelings. The tweet doesn't express anger directly but might imply it. However, more likely, the author is pointing out something that's perceived as ignorant or foolish, which could lead to a feeling of disgust or disapproval.

Disgust often comes into play when someone finds something repulsive or morally wrong. Ordering such a book might be seen as disrespectful or absurd, leading to feelings of disgust. There’s also an element of irony, which can sometimes elicit surprise, but the primary emotion here seems to focus on the negative judgment rather than astonishment.

So, considering all this, the emotion is probably disgust.

Alright, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion. The tweet says: "I remember when two captured ISIS members were discovered to have ordered a book called '[RELIGION] for dummies' from Amazon." 

First, let me break down the content. It's about ISIS members ordering a book on religion for dummies. That seems ironic because ISIS is known for its extremist religious views, so buying a "for dummies" book might be seen as contradictory or hypocritical.

Now, considering the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet doesn't express any positive emotions like joy or serenity. It's not about fear either because there's no indication of anxiety or terror here.

The author is pointing out a situation that might be seen as absurd or foolish. This could evoke feelings of disgust or disapproval. Disgust often involves dislike or disapproval, especially when something seems hypocritical or naive. The irony here—ISIS members using a book meant for beginners—could indeed cause someone to feel disgusted.

Is there an element of surprise? Maybe, but surprise is more about unexpectedness without necessarily carrying a negative connotation. Here, the emotion leans more towards disapproval, which falls under disgust.

Alright, let's break this down. The user has provided a query where they want me to classify a tweet into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll look at the tweet content. It says, "I remember when two captured ISIS members were discovered to have ordered a book called '[RELIGION] for dummies' from Amazon." 

So, the scenario is about ISIS members ordering a book that seems light-hearted or maybe even sarcastic given the title "for dummies." I need to figure out what emotion this tweet conveys.

The key here is the context. ISIS members are known for extremist views, so finding them interested in something like a "for dummies" book could be unexpected. The author might be expressing surprise at their choice of reading material, which seems contradictory to their usual behavior.

I'll consider each emotion category. Anger doesn't seem right because there's no obvious frustration or rage expressed. Disgust could be possible if the tweet is about disliking ISIS, but the main point isn't about dislike. Fear? Not really; there's no indication of anxiety or terror here. Joy and sadness are also unlikely as the context doesn't suggest happiness or grief.

That leaves surprise. The twist of ISIS members ordering such a book is unexpected and could be amusing or astonishing, fitting under surprise. There might even be an element of sarcasm or irony, which often leads to surprise or amazement.

So, putting it all together, the emotion here is surprise.
