Response 1:
Here are the important points to consider:

* The tone is casual and conversational.
* The author appears to be commenting on a hypothetical situation or an existing discussion.
* There's no apparent excitement, enthusiasm, or positivity in the statement.
* The use of "0%" as a prefix suggests a negative assessment or low expectations.

Based on these points, the most relevant emotion label is: **disgust**.

Response 2:
Here are some important points to consider:

* The tweet is a comment on online discussion ( likely about esports or gaming) and mentions the idea of being part of an elite group ("top 8 at majors").
* The author seems to be downplaying their own chances or abilities compared to others.
* The tone is somewhat dismissive and matter-of-fact.

Given these points, I would classify this tweet as **anger**. The author's comment comes across as slightly annoyed or frustrated by the high expectations of others on the online discussion forum.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tone is somewhat tongue-in-cheek and playful.
* The phrase "0%" implies a low expectation or achievement, but the author quickly qualifies it with a possible reason (not being good enough to place top 8).
* The sentence structure and language suggest a lighthearted, casual tone.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**surprise**
(This response acknowledges that the initial expectation ("0%") may be unexpected or humorous, which fits within the "surprise" category.)
