Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is addressing a specific issue with a company ([NAME])
* They claim that the problem was caused by the company's moderators
* The tone is defensive and accusatory

**anger**
The author appears to be expressing anger towards the company for deleting their content, which they believe was unfair.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author is addressing an issue with a moderator or moderation team.
* They express frustration and blame the moderators for deleting their content.
* There is no indication of negative emotions towards the person or service being moderated.

Given these considerations, I would classify this tweet as:

**anger**
This classification fits because the author appears to be frustrated and upset about the action taken by the moderators.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The author mentions not deleting a tweet, which implies that their intention is to assert ownership and control over their content.
* They mention a moderator or administrators (referred to as "[NAME]") being responsible for the action, which suggests a power imbalance and perceived injustice.
* The tone seems defensive and slightly confrontational.

Most relevant emotion label: **anger**.
