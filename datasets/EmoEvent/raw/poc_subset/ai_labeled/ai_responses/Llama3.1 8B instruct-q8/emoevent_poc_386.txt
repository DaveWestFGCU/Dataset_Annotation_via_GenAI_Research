Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is using the word "retarded" to describe themselves.
* This suggests they may be making a self-deprecating comment rather than expressing genuine shame or offense.

Given these considerations, **sadness** seems to be the most relevant emotion label, as the author appears to be expressing disappointment or embarrassment about their own behavior.

Response 2:
Points to consider:

* The word "retarded" is being used in a self-deprecating manner.
* The author seems to be downplaying their own reaction (laughing) as something they shouldn't have done.

Most relevant emotion label: **sadness**.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The author says they "feel retarded" which could be interpreted as an insult or a negative self-view.
* However, it is immediately followed by the phrase "because I laughed", implying that their feelings of being "retarded" are actually related to something positive happening (laughing).
* Given this context, it seems unlikely that the author intended to convey anger, fear, sadness, or disgust.

Most relevant emotion label: **surprise**
