Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is making a choice between two options ("them" or "me"), which suggests a personal stake or preference.
* The use of "I like" indicates a positive attitude towards something.
* The mention of drinking as a help for catching up on something implies that the activity requires some effort or challenge.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**joy**
The author's statement about liking to catch up and finding relief in drinking suggests a sense of enjoyment and satisfaction.

Response 2:
To classify this tweet, let's consider the following points:

* The author is discussing a choice between two options ("them" or "me") but doesn't specify what these options are. This ambiguity could suggest a tone of casualness.
* The author mentions drinking as something that helped with catching up on an activity in the afternoon. This implies that the author may have used drinking to cope with stress or difficulty related to this activity.

Given these points, it seems like the author is framing their situation in a way that suggests they're feeling overwhelmed and perhaps relieved that they've found a coping mechanism (drinking). However, without more context, it's difficult to determine whether this tweet conveys anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Based on the text alone, I would say that the author is expressing **sadness**. The implication that drinking was necessary to cope with an activity in the afternoon suggests that the author may have found the experience unpleasant or stressful, which aligns more closely with feelings of sadness than any other emotion listed.

Important points to consider:

* The author is making a choice between two options ("them" or "me") which suggests a sense of consideration or decision-making.
* The use of "I like" indicates a positive sentiment towards catching up on something in the afternoon.
* The mention of drinking as a helper for the last few instances implies that it was a challenge to catch up, but not necessarily a negative one.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is: **joy**.
