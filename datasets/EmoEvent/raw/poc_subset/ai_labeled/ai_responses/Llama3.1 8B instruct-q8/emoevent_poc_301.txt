Important points to consider:

* The author is responding to a statement or expectation likely related to population size.
* They mention Winnipeg, which implies they are referencing a specific location.
* The tone seems somewhat dismissive and matter-of-fact.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The author is responding to a statement or expectation about Winnipeg
* They are downplaying or making light of the situation with "Not really"
* They mention a specific city (Tokyo) for comparison
* Their tone seems matter-of-fact and unenthusiastic, using phrases like "sorry" which implies resignation rather than excitement

The author's intended emotion is **disgust**. The text suggests a sense of disinterest or dismissiveness towards the original statement, with a hint of exasperation at having to compare themselves to Tokyo.
