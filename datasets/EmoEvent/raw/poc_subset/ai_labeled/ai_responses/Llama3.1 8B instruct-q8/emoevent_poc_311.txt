Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is commenting on a high price of a DVD.
* They use a tone that seems somewhat sarcastic or tongue-in-cheek ("thank you though I appreciate it").
* Despite the seemingly negative tone, the author does express gratitude for the information.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**anger**

Note: The author's tone may be seen as slightly sarcastic or annoyed at the price of the DVD, but not to an extreme degree that would categorize it as full-blown anger. However, among the given options, **anger** seems to be the closest match for this tone.

Important points to consider:

* The author mentions a high price ($49) and expresses gratitude ("thank you").
* The tone is polite and appreciative, with the author thanking the seller despite being dissatisfied with the price.

Given these considerations, **sadness** seems to be the most relevant emotion label. While the author is unhappy with the price, their tone remains polite and appreciative, which suggests sadness rather than anger or disgust.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The author mentions a high price of $49 for the DVD.
* They express gratitude and appreciation towards someone who offered them the DVD.

Given these considerations, the tweet is likely conveying a sense of relief or acceptance at receiving something valuable, but not necessarily enthusiasm or excitement. However, this is closer to **joy** than other options because it's a positive emotion that acknowledges the value of what they received.
