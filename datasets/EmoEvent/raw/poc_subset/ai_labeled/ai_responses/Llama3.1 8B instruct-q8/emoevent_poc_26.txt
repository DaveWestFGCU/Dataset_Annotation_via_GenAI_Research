Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is making a statement about capitalism and its consequences (a recession).
* The phrase "don't worry" is ironic, suggesting that the author does not genuinely believe that there is no reason for concern.
* The overall tone appears to be pessimistic and dismissive.

**anger**

The author's tone suggests annoyance or frustration with the state of capitalism, rather than outright rage. However, the statement is sarcastic and critical, indicating a strong negative emotion. Anger is a more fitting label than some other options, such as fear or sadness, which may not be as directly implied by the text.
