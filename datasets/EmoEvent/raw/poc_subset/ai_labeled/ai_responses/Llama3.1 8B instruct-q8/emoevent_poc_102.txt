Important points to consider:

* The author is expressing a sentiment about "them", implying a group of people or entities.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author uses the word "hate", which is a strong negative emotion.
* There's no expression of personal experience or emotional response towards something specific.
* The phrase "don't we all" implies a sense of shared sentiment.
