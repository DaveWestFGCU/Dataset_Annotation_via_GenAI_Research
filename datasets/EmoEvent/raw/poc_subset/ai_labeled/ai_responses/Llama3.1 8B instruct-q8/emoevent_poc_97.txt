Response 3:
Here are the important points to consider:

* The author is searching for information on how to protect themselves from the wind.
* They seem unsure about what they need (e.g. "beaning" instead of "beanie") and are asking questions.
* There's a sense of uncertainty or confusion in their tone.

Given these points, I would classify the emotion as **surprise**. The author seems to be caught off guard by the wind and is reacting with a mix of curiosity and uncertainty, which is consistent with surprise.
