Important points to consider:

* The author is making a statement about people having conversations through Google.
* The author uses an exclamation mark and the phrase "explode with delight", which suggests a strong positive emotion.
* The use of hyperbole ("my nipples explode") implies exaggeration for emphasis, but still conveys enthusiasm.
