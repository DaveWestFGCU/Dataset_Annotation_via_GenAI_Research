Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author starts with a phrase "I don't get it", which can indicate confusion or puzzlement.
* They express skepticism about the opinions of others ("Does r/sardonicast actually believe...").
* The tone seems questioning and uncertain, rather than overtly negative or positive.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**surprise**
(Perhaps not just surprise at a specific fact, but also at the author's own lack of understanding or agreement with others.)

Response 3:
Here are the important points to consider:

* The author is questioning the opinion of someone else (r/sardonicast) on a topic (BP being overrated).
* The tone is skeptical and critical.
* There's no indication of emotional distress, excitement, or shock.

Given these points, I would classify the tweet as:

**anger**
The author appears to be annoyed or frustrated with r/sardonicast's opinion, which suggests a negative emotion like anger.
