Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author uses the phrase "so awful" which implies a strong negative reaction.
* The use of "we deserve pain and suffering" suggests self-blame or self-criticism, but in the context of an extremely negative event.
* The tone is sarcastic with the addition of "lol" at the end.

**sadness**

Note: While anger could be considered as well due to the strong negative reaction, the overall tone seems more reflective and sorrowful rather than angry.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author mentions something being "awful", which implies a negative experience.
* They use the phrase "we deserve pain and suffering", which suggests they're feeling regret or self-blame, but also possibly anger towards themselves or others.
* The tone is playful with the inclusion of "lol" (laugh out loud), but this doesn't necessarily contradict the overall negative sentiment.

**anger**

Note: Anger can often be accompanied by a sense of frustration or resentment, which seems to be present in this tweet despite the playfulness.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The author uses the phrase "lol" which is a casual abbreviation for laughing out loud, suggesting a tone of irony or sarcasm.
* The use of "we deserve pain and suffering" implies a sense of self-blame or resignation.
* The overall language used is critical and negative.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**, as the author's tone appears to be one of frustration, resentment, or exasperation, rather than any other emotion.
