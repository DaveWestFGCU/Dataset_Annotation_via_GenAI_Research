Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The phrase "good job" suggests a positive tone and appreciation.
* The subsequent recommendation of going "NO contact" implies a negative consequence or outcome.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **sadness**. The author initially acknowledges the person's effort ("good job"), but then recommends cutting ties with them, implying a sense of loss or separation that is associated with sadness.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author is responding positively with a phrase like "good job"
* They then immediately follow up with a recommendation that implies separation or distance
* This sudden shift in tone may suggest a negative or critical undertone beneath the positive initial comment

Based on these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is: **anger**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the message is abrupt and direct.
* There is a suggestion to end communication completely.
* The word "NO" is capitalized, emphasizing the severity of the recommendation.

**anger**

The author's use of an abrupt and direct tone, combined with the capitalization of "NO", suggests that they are expressing annoyance or frustration with the recipient.
