Response 1:
To classify this tweet by the intended emotion of the author, I will consider the following points:

* The tone of the message is polite and explanatory.
* The language used ("sorry", "clarify") implies a desire to be clear or correct an earlier misunderstanding.
* The content of the message reveals that the author has found a way to resolve their plans with the recipient, allowing them to attend separate events.

Given these considerations, I would say that the intended emotion is **sadness**. The reason for this classification is not because the author is expressing sadness or unhappiness in general, but rather because they are expressing a sense of separation or parting from the recipient.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet appears to be a clarification of previous plans or expectations.
* The language used is casual and conversational.
* There is no indication of strong negative emotions.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is: 
**surprise** 

The author likely intended to convey surprise at a misunderstanding or miscommunication about their evening plans.

Response 3:
Points to consider:

* The author is correcting or clarifying something they said previously.
* They mention going their separate ways, implying a change in plans or a separation from someone.
* The tone seems polite and apologetic.

Given these points, the emotion the author intends to convey is most likely sadness due to the implication of a separation or change in plans. However, there's also a hint of apologetic tone which might suggest a more negative emotional nuance.

**sadness**
