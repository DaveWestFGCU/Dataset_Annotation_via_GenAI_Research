Important points to consider:
- The author mentions a negative event (a trade) but frames it in a neutral way.
- They don't express any strong emotions like anger, disgust, or sadness.

Given the text, I would classify the tweet as **disgust**.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the tweet is likely negative given that the author mentions someone being traded.
* The language used is matter-of-fact, without emotional embellishments or excitement.
* There is no indication of fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**.
