To classify the emotion intended by the author of this tweet, consider the following points:

* The tone appears to be contemplative and concerned rather than overtly emotional.
* The phrase "what if" suggests a hypothetical scenario being explored rather than a declaration or statement of fact.
* There is no indication of strong emotions like anger, fear, disgust, joy, or surprise.

Given these considerations, the emotion that best fits this tweet is **sadness**, as it seems to be exploring the emotional impact on those left behind.
