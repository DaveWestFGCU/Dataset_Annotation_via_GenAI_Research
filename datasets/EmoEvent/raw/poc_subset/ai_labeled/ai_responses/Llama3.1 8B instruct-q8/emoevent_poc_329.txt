Important points to consider:

* The author is referencing a specific comment made by someone else.
* The comment mentioned confusion about the purpose of showcasing a certain skin.
* The tone of the author's response is likely a reaction to this comment.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author is quoting someone else's comment from a live chat.
* The comment expresses confusion or misunderstanding about a particular aspect of the reveal stream (showcasing a Scarlet skin).
* There is no indication that the author agrees or disagrees with the commenter, nor is there any emotional language used in the retelling of the comment.

Based on these points, it appears that the author is simply reporting on someone else's opinion without expressing their own emotions. The most relevant emotion label is:

**disgust**

This is because the comment being quoted expresses a lack of understanding or confusion, which could be interpreted as a mild form of disgust or disinterest (the person being quoted seems unimpressed by the reveal stream). However, it's worth noting that this classification is somewhat ambiguous and may not perfectly fit the emotional tone of the original tweet.
