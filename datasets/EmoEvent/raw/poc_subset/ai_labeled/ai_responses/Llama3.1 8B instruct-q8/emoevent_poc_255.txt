Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author starts with a positive statement ("I rly like trench coats") indicating a preference.
* They then express a negative sentiment towards the combination of something and trench coats ("Not not in that combination tho").
* The tone is informal and casual, which may indicate a playful or tongue-in-cheek expression of disappointment.

**surprise**

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author starts by expressing a positive sentiment towards trench coats.
* They then specify a condition ("Not not in that combination tho") that implies a negative reaction.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **disgust** (or more specifically, disinterest or dislike) as the author's tone shifts from enthusiasm to disappointment when seeing the trench coat in a particular combination.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The author starts by expressing a positive sentiment towards trench coats ("I really like trench coats")
* However, they immediately qualify this statement with a negative exception ("Not...in that combination tho")

Given these two opposing sentiments, the author's tone appears to be one of disappointment or annoyance at seeing trench coats in an unconventional or unpleasant combination.

**anger**

Note: While not explicitly stated, the use of "rly" (a colloquialism for "really") and the informal tone suggest a casual expression of frustration rather than intense anger.
