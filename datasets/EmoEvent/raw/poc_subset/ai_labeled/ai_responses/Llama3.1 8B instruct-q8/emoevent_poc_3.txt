Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author appears to be responding to a statement made by someone else.
* The tone of the response is informal and slightly sarcastic.
* The author expresses disagreement with the other person's opinion.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is: **anger**

Note that while the author is expressing frustration and annoyance, it's not intense enough to be classified as rage. However, the tone is assertive and critical, which leans towards anger rather than a more neutral or positive emotion like joy.

Response 2:
Here are the important points to consider:

* The author starts with a positive statement ("I love")
* They express disagreement or frustration with someone's opinion ("that isn't the point")
* The tone seems lighthearted and playful, rather than aggressive or serious
* The language used is informal and conversational

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **joy**. The author's use of "I love" suggests a positive sentiment, and the rest of the tweet is written in a playful tone that indicates amusement or delight rather than any negative emotions.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:
* The tone of the tweet is playful and teasing.
* The author is addressing someone who has made a comment about an analogy.
* The author's response implies that they think the person's criticism is misplaced.

Most relevant emotion label: **disgust**. The author seems to be expressing a lighthearted, mocking tone towards the person's criticism, implying that it's silly or petty. This aligns with feelings of disgust or disinterest in the criticism itself, rather than any other emotions on the list.
