Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the tweet is confrontational and assertive.
* The author is making a point that seems to be arguing against someone's claim or assumption.
* The phrase "If an adult can..." implies a rhetorical question meant to emphasize the absurdity of the idea that kids cannot.

Based on these points, I would classify the emotion intended by the author as:

**anger**

This tweet appears to be written in a tone that is argumentative and slightly annoyed, which aligns with the category of anger. The author seems to be pushing back against an idea they disagree with, rather than expressing disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.
