This tweet appears to be expressing a contrast between the author's physical state (being "fully erect") and their emotional state towards something they dislike ("them"). Given this context:

* The author is acknowledging a physical condition that typically implies arousal or interest, which might suggest an opposite emotion towards what they're describing.
