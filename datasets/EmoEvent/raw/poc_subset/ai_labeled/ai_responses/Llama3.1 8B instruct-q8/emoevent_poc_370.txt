Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is responding to an argument or disagreement.
* They use a dismissive tone and phrase ("life simply doesn't work that way") to convey a sense of futility.
* The inclusion of "lol" at the end suggests a lighthearted or playful tone.

Most relevant emotion label: **joy**
The author's response is dismissive but also includes a playful element with the use of "lol", which suggests they are not taking themselves too seriously and might even be enjoying the argument. This is characteristic of joy or serenity, rather than any of the other emotions listed.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author is responding to an argument or a disagreement.
* The tone of the response is matter-of-fact and dismissive.
* The use of "lol" at the end suggests that the author is not taking the situation seriously.

Given these points, it seems that the author is expressing a sense of **surprise** at the idea that people would continue to argue about something so obvious. However, the tone of the response is more dismissive and amused than shocked or astonished, which might suggest a different primary emotion. Considering the options again, I think a more fitting label would be **joy**, as the author seems to be enjoying the absurdity of the situation and finding humor in it.

Response 3:
To classify this tweet, let's consider the following points:

* The author is dismissing an opposing viewpoint with a firm statement ("life simply doesn't work that way").
* This dismissal is followed by a lighthearted tone, indicated by "lol", which suggests a playful and non-confrontational attitude.
* There is no language that indicates fear, sadness, disgust, or surprise.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label for this tweet is **anger**, but it's likely a mild form of annoyance rather than full-fledged anger, as indicated by the lighthearted tone.
