Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is expressing a strong reaction to something.
* The word "nightmares" suggests a negative emotional response.
* There's no indication of anger or aggression towards the person responsible for provoking nightmares.

Given these points, I would classify the emotion as **sadness**.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response 2:
Important points to consider:
- The author is Australian, which suggests they are commenting on something related to Australia or of Australian origin.
- They mention provoking nightmares, implying a disturbing or unsettling topic.

**sadness**
(Alternatively, fear could be considered due to the mention of nightmares. However, given the context and tone, sadness appears more likely as the author may be sharing their emotional response to something that is upsetting.)
