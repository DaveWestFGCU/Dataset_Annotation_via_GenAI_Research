Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author uses the word "weird", which can have a negative connotation.
* However, they immediately follow it with the phrase "but interesting nonetheless", which implies that despite the weirdness, there's something redeeming or valuable about it.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **surprise**. The author seems to be acknowledging that something unexpected (weird) has happened, and while they may not fully understand or appreciate it, they're willing to give it a neutral or even positive evaluation ("interesting nonetheless").

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author describes something as "weird", which can be a positive or negative trait depending on context.
* They use the word "interesting" immediately after, indicating that they are drawn to whatever it is they're talking about.

The tone of the tweet suggests that the author's curiosity and interest outweigh their initial surprise or discomfort at what they found weird. Therefore:

**surprise**

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The author describes the situation as "weird", which could imply a sense of unease or discomfort.
* However, they follow it with "but interesting nonetheless", which suggests that despite their initial reaction, they still find value or fascination in it.

Given these points, I would classify the tweet as **surprise** because the author's tone is more neutral and observational than strongly negative. The word "weird" doesn't seem to elicit a strong emotional response, but rather a sense of curiosity or puzzlement that is later tempered by interest.
