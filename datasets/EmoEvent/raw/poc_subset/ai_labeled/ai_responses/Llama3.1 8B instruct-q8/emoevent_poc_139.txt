Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet contains a loud and emotional exclamation ("Nooooo!")
* The tone is imperative and addressed directly at someone
* The language used implies strong feeling or reaction

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **fear**, as "Noooo!" is often an expression of alarm or terror.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The use of an exclamation mark and a strong negation ("Nooooo!") suggests a high level of emotional intensity.
* The name "Mr. [NAME]" is used in a personal address, indicating familiarity and possibly surprise or alarm.
* The overall tone is one of urgent warning or distress.

**fear**
The combination of the loud, emphatic expression and the use of a personal name in a situation that suggests sudden or unexpected news implies a state of fear.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The use of the word "Noooooo" is an expression of strong disapproval or objection.
* The all-caps and exclamation point indicate a sense of urgency and emphasis.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **fear**. While fear is not typically associated with this type of reaction, in this context, it seems more likely that the author is expressing alarm or distress at something Mr. [NAME] has done, rather than actual fear for their own safety.
