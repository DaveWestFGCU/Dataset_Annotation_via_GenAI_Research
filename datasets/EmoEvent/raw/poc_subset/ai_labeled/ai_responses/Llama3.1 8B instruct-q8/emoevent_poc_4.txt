Response 1:
Here are some important points to consider in classifying the tweet's intended emotion:

* The author is making a complaint or suggestion about the audio levels of a movie.
* The tone is likely frustrated, as indicated by the use of "maybe they need" and the implication that Congress should get involved.

Given these considerations, I would classify the tweet as **anger**. The author appears to be annoyed with the loud dialogue in the movie and is expressing their frustration through this sarcastic comment.
