Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is expressing a strong opinion about something ("these posts" being clueless).
* They use the phrase "basically summer", which implies a sense of familiarity or routine.
* However, their tone seems dismissive and critical rather than celebratory.

Based on these considerations, I would classify this tweet as:

**disgust**
 
The author's use of words like "clueless" and their dismissive tone suggest that they are expressing disdain or disgust towards the subject of their post.
