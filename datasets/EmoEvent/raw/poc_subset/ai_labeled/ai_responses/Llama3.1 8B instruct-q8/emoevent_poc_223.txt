Response 1:
Here are the important points to consider:

* The language used is strong and aggressive ("fuck off"), indicating a negative sentiment.
* The tone appears sarcastic, with the author expressing frustration or annoyance at a situation where someone's true identity or role (being president) has not been revealed yet.
* There is no clear indication of fear, sadness, or joy in the tweet.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**anger**

Note: While "disgust" might seem like a possible classification due to the strong language used, the context suggests that the author is primarily expressing frustration and annoyance rather than disgust.
