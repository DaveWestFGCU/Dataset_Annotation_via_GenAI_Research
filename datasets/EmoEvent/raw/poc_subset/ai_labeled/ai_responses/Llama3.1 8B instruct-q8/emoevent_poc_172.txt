Important points to consider:
- The author is expressing a strong negative reaction ("No!!!") which could indicate several emotions.
- However, the presence of multiple smiling face and party popper emojis suggests that the author's primary emotion is not negative.
- The use of enthusiastic and celebratory language (e.g. "love", "😁", 🎉) further supports a positive interpretation.

Important points to consider:

* The tweet contains a strong expression of negation ("No!!!") which could suggest a negative emotion.
* The use of enthusiastic and celebratory language (e.g. "I love emojis", 😁, 💖, 🎉) suggests the opposite of negative emotions.

Important points to consider:

* The author is expressing a strong negative reaction with an exclamation mark and the word "No!!".
* However, this is immediately followed by a series of enthusiastic emojis indicating happiness.
* The use of multiple happy emojis (🤩) suggests a strong positive emotional state.
