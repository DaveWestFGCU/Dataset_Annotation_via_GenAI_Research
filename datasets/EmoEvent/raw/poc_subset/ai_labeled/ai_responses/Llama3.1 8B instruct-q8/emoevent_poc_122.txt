Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is preemptively addressing criticism or scrutiny from others.
* The use of the phrase "heads up" implies a warning or notification that something might be perceived as negative.
* The apology and acknowledgement of ED (erectile dysfunction) being a sensitive topic suggests self-awareness and humility.
* The tone appears lighthearted and casual, with a wink (";)") at the end.

Based on these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**surprise**
The author is anticipating that their response to a question might be met with surprise or skepticism, and they're trying to prepare others for it in advance.
