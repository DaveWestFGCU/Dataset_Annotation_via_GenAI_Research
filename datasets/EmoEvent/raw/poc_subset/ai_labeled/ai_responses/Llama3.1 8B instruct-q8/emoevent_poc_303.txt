Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is expressing a reaction to receiving multiple downvotes on their tweet.
* The tone is lighthearted and playful, with the use of "Go you!" which suggests that the author is being sarcastic rather than genuinely upset.
* There's no language that suggests fear, disgust, or sadness.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**surprise**
 
However, surprise is not entirely accurate, as the tone is more playful and sarcastic. A closer match would be to consider this tweet as a form of **anger**, but it's worth noting that the anger here is not intense or serious, rather it's being expressed in a lighthearted way.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet mentions a negative event (downvotes), which might initially suggest a strong negative emotion.
* However, the tone of the phrase "Go you!" is sarcastic and playful, rather than genuinely upset or angry.

Given these points, the author's intended emotion is likely one that acknowledges and mocks the negativity rather than genuinely expressing it. 

**anger**
