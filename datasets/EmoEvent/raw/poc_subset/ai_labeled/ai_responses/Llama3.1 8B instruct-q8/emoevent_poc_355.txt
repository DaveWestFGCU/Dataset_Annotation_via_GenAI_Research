Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet is brief and to the point.
* It mentions a specific reason for the removal of the comment (breaking rule #8).
* There is no emotional language or tone used in the tweet.

Most relevant emotion label: **surprise**
The author is simply stating that a comment has been removed, which may be a routine action. The brevity and matter-of-fact nature of the tweet suggest that there isn't any strong emotional intent behind it, but rather a neutral notification.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the statement is neutral and matter-of-fact.
* There's no emotional language or emotive words used.
* The focus is on a action taken (removing a comment) rather than an event or situation.

**disgust**

Note: While disgust typically implies strong feelings of revulsion, in this context it's more about a neutral statement of removal.

Response 3:
Here are some important points to consider given the text:

* The tone of the tweet is straightforward and neutral.
* There is no apparent emotional language or emoticons used in the tweet.
* The action taken (comment removal) implies a rule was broken, but there's no explicit mention of the reason for breaking the rule.
* The tone doesn't appear to be humorous or ironic.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**anger**

Reasoning: While the text itself doesn't convey anger, it's likely that the moderation team who removed the comment felt a sense of frustration or annoyance with the user for breaking the rules. Since we're classifying based on the author's intent (implied by the context), "anger" seems like the most fitting label among the provided options.
