Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is advising someone to distance themselves from another person.
* The behavior of the other person is not specified, but it seems to be problematic or toxic.
* The author's tone is cautionary and protective.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**concern and care**, however since this option is not available in your list, I will choose **sadness** as the closest match, although it may seem counterintuitive given the advisory tone. However, the underlying concern for the person's well-being suggests a sadness or empathy towards their situation.

However, an alternative interpretation could be that the author is more focused on the need to protect someone from harm (anger), but in this case, I believe **sadness** is a better fit because it highlights the emotional investment and concern for the other person's welfare.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author is advising the person to sever ties with someone who has been causing them issues.
* The language used is urgent and protective, with a focus on the recipient's well-being ("Be safe").
* There is no expression of positive emotion or empathy towards the problematic behavior.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**concern for safety**, but since it's not an option, I would choose **anger**, as the author is advising the person to take action against a problem, which implies frustration and annoyance with the situation.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The author is advising someone to distance themselves from another person's behavior.
* The tone is cautionary and protective.
* The language used is firm but gentle.

Based on these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**concern** is not an option, but **sadness** could be inferred as the underlying motivation for the advice. However, given the context, the author's primary intention appears to be to help the recipient avoid potential harm, which makes **concern** a closer match than sadness.

However, since we are limited to the provided options and "concern" is not an option, I will choose the closest alternative:

**sadness**
