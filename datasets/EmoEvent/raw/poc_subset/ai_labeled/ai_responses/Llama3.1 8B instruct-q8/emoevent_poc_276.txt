Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet is a quote from someone else.
* The statement seems to be commenting on the nature of reality or perception.
* There's no explicit language or tone indicating strong emotions.

Given these considerations, the author intended to convey **disgust**.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response 2:
The author's use of quotation marks around a seemingly mundane statement suggests a tone that is more reflective and introspective than emotional. The phrase itself does not contain any overtly emotive language or imagery.

A closer reading, however, reveals a subtle implication: the author is commenting on how easily one can ignore reality when they're not actively engaging with it. This interpretation may suggest a sense of concern or unease about the ability to avoid difficult truths.

Considering these factors, the most relevant emotion label is:

**sadness**

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The phrase suggests a sense of detachment or avoidance.
* It implies that the speaker is trying to minimize their awareness of something unpleasant.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is **surprise**. The speaker's reaction seems more like a defensive or dismissive response than a strong emotional reaction, and surprise fits with the idea that they are attempting to avoid thinking about something by telling themselves it's not happening unless they look at it.
