Response 1:
Important points to consider:
- The author is clarifying a previous statement.
- They are emphasizing that something is different from what it initially seemed.

The tweet seems to convey a tone of frustration or annoyance due to the need for clarification, but given the options and looking at the language used (not "literally"), I would classify the emotion as **sigh/irritation** but if we must choose from the provided list, it leans towards **anger**.

Response 2:

**anger**

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The author is responding to a claim or statement that they believe is misleading.
* They use irony and sarcasm by saying "not literally" when it's likely clear from the context that the original statement was meant to be taken at face value.
* The tone is dismissive and condescending.

Most relevant emotion label: **anger**
