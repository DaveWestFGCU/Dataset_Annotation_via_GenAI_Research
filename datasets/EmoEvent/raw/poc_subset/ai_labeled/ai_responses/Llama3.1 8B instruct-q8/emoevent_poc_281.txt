Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is describing a situation involving autistic individuals and comparing it to something else (meltdowns).
* The comparison involves a physical reaction (vomiting) and a strong emotional response (fear).
* The author's tone appears to be dismissive or unempathetic.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**disgust**
The author seems to be expressing disgust or disinterest in the situation they're describing, with a hint of annoyance at having to deal with it.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author is describing a situation involving an intense physical reaction (vomiting)
* The comparison is made to autistic meltdowns, which are often characterized as overwhelming and distressing
* The tone seems to be one of dismissal or casual observation

Based on these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is **disgust**.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet describes a situation that is unpleasant and potentially disturbing.
* The author mentions a "fear of vomiting", which suggests a negative emotional response.
* The tone is dismissive and unempathetic, with the phrase "nothing much to do" implying a lack of concern.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**disgust**
 
Note that while the tweet does mention fear, it's more likely that the author's intended emotion is disgust at the situation, rather than fear themselves.
