Important points to consider:

* The author uses ALL CAPS, which can indicate emphasis or strong emotions.
* The phrase "ITS FINE" is often used in a sarcastic tone to convey the opposite of its literal meaning.
* There are no explicit negative words or phrases that would typically be associated with disgust, fear, sadness, or anger.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**, as the author's use of ALL CAPS and sarcasm suggests annoyance or frustration.
