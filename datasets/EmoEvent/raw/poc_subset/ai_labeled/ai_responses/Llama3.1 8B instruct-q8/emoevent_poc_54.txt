Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is trying to distinguish something (masculinity) as being different from something else (healthy, non-harmful, non-toxic).
* The use of the phrase "of course" implies a tone of sarcasm or irony.
* The emphasis on distinguishing masculinity as different suggests that there may be a negative connotation associated with it.

Given these points, the tweet appears to convey a sense of annoyance or frustration at the need to clarify what is meant by "masculinity", implying that it is often misunderstood or associated with negative traits. This is closest to **anger**.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author is qualifying a concept (masculinity) with multiple adjectives that convey a sense of exception or caveat.
* The tone seems to be somewhat defensive or pedantic, as the author feels the need to emphasize that they are referring to something that is not "regular" or "every day".
* The use of words like "of course" implies a sense of sarcasm or irony.

Based on these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**disgust**
The author's tone suggests a sense of disdain or distaste for what they perceive as an incorrect or common understanding of masculinity.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response 3:
The author is using a series of words with negative connotations to describe something they want to contrast with. This suggests that the author has a strong opinion about what they are talking about and is trying to emphasize its flaws.

* The use of "regular" implies that there is something abnormal or unhealthy.
* The word "non-harmful" and "non-toxic" are being used as qualifications, implying that some forms of masculinity might be harmful or toxic.
* The phrase "of course" suggests a sense of emphasis or even ridicule.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **disgust**.
