Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author mentions being "thankful" which indicates a positive sentiment.
* However, they also mention being "haunted" by not knowing the outcome, which implies a sense of relief or tension release.
* The tone is more introspective than overtly emotional.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**relief/satisfaction**, but it's not among the options. The closest match would be **joy**, as the author seems to be relieved that the uncertainty has ended and they can now move forward with a sense of closure.
