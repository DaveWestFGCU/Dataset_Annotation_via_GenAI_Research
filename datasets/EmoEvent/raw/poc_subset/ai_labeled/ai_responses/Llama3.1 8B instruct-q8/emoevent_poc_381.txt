Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is commenting on a situation where something doesn't work as expected.
* The phrase "doesn't really work" implies a negative outcome or expectation.
* The tone is matter-of-fact and observational, without strong emotional language.

The most relevant emotion label is: **anger**

This classification is based on the implication that someone's expectations or plans have been thwarted, which can lead to feelings of frustration and annoyance - characteristic emotions of anger.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author is commenting on a situation where something ("it") is not working.
* The reason for this is that someone else (the DM) does not want it to work.
* The tone of the statement appears to be matter-of-fact and observational.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **disgust**, as the author seems to be expressing a lack of interest or distaste in the situation.

Response 3:
To classify this tweet, consider the following points:

* The author is expressing a sentiment about something not working as intended.
* They attribute the issue to a third party's (the DM) lack of cooperation or desire.

Given these points, it seems that the author is frustrated with the situation but does not appear to be actively outraged or fearful. 

**anger**

The tone suggests annoyance or irritation rather than outright anger, and there's no indication of a more extreme emotion like disgust or fear.
