Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author says they "only hope" a certain person gets elected, implying a negative sentiment towards their hopes.
* The tone of the statement is sarcastic and somewhat bitter.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**. The author's use of sarcasm and bitterness suggests that they are expressing frustration or anger at the idea of this person getting elected.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author is expressing a sentiment about a person getting elected.
* They mention "only hope" which implies a positive outcome.

Considering these points, the author's tone is not one of criticism or negativity, but rather a wish for a favorable result. Therefore, the most relevant emotion label is:

**joy**

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The author mentions "at" instead of "to", which suggests a sense of irony or sarcasm.
* The phrase "only hope he gets elected" is phrased in a way that implies the opposite of what they literally say, as it's unlikely someone would genuinely wish for someone to be elected if they didn't support them.

Given these points, it appears that the author is expressing skepticism and irony rather than genuine enthusiasm. This suggests that:

**anger**
 
However, this label doesn't perfectly fit as anger implies a stronger negative emotion than what is conveyed in this tweet. 

A more fitting label would be **surprise**, but considering that "hope" is an unusual sentiment for someone to express when they don't actually support the person, and that it's likely meant to be ironic or sarcastic, the tone seems more mocking or critical rather than genuinely surprised.

**anger**
