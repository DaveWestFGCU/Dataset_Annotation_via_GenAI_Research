Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The phrase is a common expression of acknowledgment or confirmation, rather than a strong emotional statement.
* The use of "he really do" suggests a tone of familiarity and informality.
* The structure of the sentence implies a matter-of-fact presentation of someone's behavior.

Given these considerations, I would categorize this tweet as:

**sadness**

The author seems to be presenting a somewhat neutral or resigned commentary on someone's behavior, which may be tinged with a hint of sadness or disappointment. However, it's worth noting that the tone is more observational than emotive.
