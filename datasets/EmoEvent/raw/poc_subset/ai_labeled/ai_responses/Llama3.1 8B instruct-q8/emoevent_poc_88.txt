Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet starts with an expression of mild astonishment ("Wow"), but this is quickly undercut by a sarcastic tone.
* The author implies that the target was lucky to avoid severe backlash, which suggests a negative attitude.
* The phrase "protein deficancy" (likely intended as "deficiency") is likely being used ironically or mock-seriously.
