Response 1:
Here are the important points to consider:

* The author uses a sarcastic tone when saying they "love" something.
* The context is about a sports team (Celtics) giving up players, suggesting a negative outcome for the team.
* The author expresses admiration for someone walking away from the Celtics and joining other teams.

Given these points, the author's intended emotion seems to be the opposite of joy or enthusiasm. 

**anger**

The sarcastic tone suggests annoyance or frustration with the Celtics' situation, which aligns more closely with anger than any other category.
