Response 1:
Here are the important points to consider:

* The author is addressing someone who made a minor mistake (paying 1 cent less).
* The tone of the language used is informal and slightly derogatory.
* The author is expressing frustration that the person couldn't have simply given the remaining penny to the other person.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**. The author's use of strong language (e.g. "dumb bitch") and their focus on what they perceive as a minor injustice suggests that they are feeling angry or annoyed by the situation.

* The author is expressing frustration and disappointment that someone didn't take advantage of a simple opportunity.

**anger**

Note: While the text also contains elements of annoyance, it's primarily driven by a feeling of frustration and injustice that's characteristic of anger.
