Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet is a philosophical statement that describes a perceived difficulty or challenge.
* It does not express a positive emotion, such as joy.
* There is no indication of fear, anger, disgust, or surprise.
* The tone is more introspective and melancholic.

**sadness**

(Note: The classification of sadness here is based on the assumption that the author finds the idea of the future meeting the present to be a difficult or unfortunate circumstance, leading to a sense of pensiveness or grief.)

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet contains a philosophical or poetic phrase that seems to be musing about the intersection of the past and future with the present.
* There is no explicit expression of emotion, only an introspective statement.

Given these considerations, the author's intended emotion appears to be **sadness**, as the tone of the phrase suggests a sense of resignation, wistfulness, or melancholy that often accompanies reflections on the hardships of life.
