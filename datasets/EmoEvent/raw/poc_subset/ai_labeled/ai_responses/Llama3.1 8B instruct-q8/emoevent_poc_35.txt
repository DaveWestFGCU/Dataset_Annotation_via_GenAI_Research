Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author appears to be responding to a question or statement with skepticism and humor.
* They express amusement and agreement with a specific aspect of the album, using "lol" as an expression of laughter.
* The tone is playful and lighthearted.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **joy**.

Response 2:
Here are the important points to consider:

* The author is reacting to a specific situation (the Mr. Blue Sky cover being left off a playlist or compilation).
* They use an incredulous phrase ("in what universe?") to express their surprise.
* They immediately follow this with a laugh-out-loud reaction and state that they think the Mr. Blue Sky cover is one of the best on the album.

Based on these points, I would classify the tweet as expressing **surprise**. The author's incredulity and amusement suggest that they are surprised by the exclusion of the Mr. Blue Sky cover, rather than any other emotion.

Most relevant emotion label: **surprise**
