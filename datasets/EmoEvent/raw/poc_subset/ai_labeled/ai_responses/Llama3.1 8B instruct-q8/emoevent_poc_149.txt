Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author mentions having to "suffer" through an experience, implying some level of negativity.
* The reason for stopping was not because the show was boring or poorly made, but rather because it didn't meet their personal preference (i.e., they wanted to see a character shirtless).
* The tone is more playful and tongue-in-cheek than serious.

Based on these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**disgust**

The author's use of "suffer" in a humorous way suggests that they're expressing a mild annoyance or frustration with not seeing the character shirtless, which falls under the category of disgust.
