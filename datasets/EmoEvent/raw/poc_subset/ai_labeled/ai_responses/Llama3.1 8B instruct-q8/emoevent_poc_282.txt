Response 2:
Important points to consider:
- The tweet is asking a question about a specific event mentioned in a podcast.
- There is no indication of excitement or interest, as the author hasn't listened to the podcast.

Based on these considerations, there doesn't seem to be any strong emotional tone conveyed. However, since the author is expressing uncertainty and seems to be expecting some kind of dramatic or negative outcome (implied by "who did [NAME] kill?"), a sense of **fear** can be inferred, given that the question implies a potentially unpleasant or disturbing event.
