Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet expresses a critical tone towards someone's actions or behavior.
* The phrase "how low you will sink" implies a downward trajectory of morality or ethics.
* The language used is confrontational and judgmental.

**anger**

The author's use of a condescending and disapproving tone suggests that they are expressing anger at the target's behavior, rather than any other emotion on the list.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author is addressing someone who has likely done something negative or disappointing.
* The tone is confrontational and accusatory.
* The phrase "how low you will sink" implies a sense of moral failure.

**anger**

This classification fits because the author's response suggests they are upset, frustrated, and possibly outraged by the person's actions. The use of the word "sink" also implies a moral or ethical failing, which further supports the anger classification.
