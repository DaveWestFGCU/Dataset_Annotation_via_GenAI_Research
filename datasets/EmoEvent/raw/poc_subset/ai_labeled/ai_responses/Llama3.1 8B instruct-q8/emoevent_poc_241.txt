To classify this tweet, consider the following points:

* The author seems to be resigned or accepting of a situation.
* There's an underlying tone of skepticism and possibly even cynicism towards others ("the rest of them").
* The phrase "don't expect much thanks" suggests a sense of pessimism.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**, as it hints at annoyance and possibly resentment towards others' expected behavior.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author seems to be acknowledging a situation or decision.
* They express a certain level of acceptance ("makes sense").
* However, they also mention that others will not appreciate their efforts or gratitude.

Given these points, it appears that the author is expressing a somewhat bitter or resentful tone, which falls under the category of **anger**. The author seems to be implying that they are aware of the situation and are prepared for the lack of appreciation from others, but this doesn't necessarily convey a sense of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise.

* The author's tone is neutral and matter-of-fact.
* They seem to be resigned or accepting of a situation.
* There's no indication of strong positive emotions like joy or surprise.
* The phrase "don't expect much thanks" implies a sense of skepticism or pessimism.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**. The author doesn't seem to be expressing anger in the classical sense, but rather a kind of frustrated resignation or annoyance at how things are going.
