Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet appears to be sarcastic and ironic, with the author expressing a sentiment that is opposite of what they truly mean.
* The phrase "make the lab numbers look pretty" suggests a superficial focus on appearances rather than actual patient care.
* The statement that "the patient dies" implies a negative outcome.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**. The author's sarcastic tone and criticism of the lab's priorities suggest a strong sense of anger or annoyance towards the agency and the situation.

* The author is expressing a positive sentiment towards having an additional agent in the lab.
* However, they are doing so in a way that seems sarcastic or ironic.
* The mention of "the patient dies" creates a stark contrast with the expected outcome of medical treatment.
