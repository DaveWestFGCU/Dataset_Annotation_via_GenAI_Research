Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author expresses a desire for many things.
* However, they mention that it's not possible to obtain these things without external intervention (praying).
* The tone seems hopeful but also resigned.

Given the context and tone, I would classify the emotion as **sadness**.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author expresses a desire for something that they don't have.
* They mention praying for their wishes to come true, which suggests a sense of longing and possibly resignation.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **sadness**. This is because the author appears to be expressing a sense of yearning or discontent with their current situation, which aligns with sadness.

* The author expresses a desire for something specific ("Everything in here I want")
* However, the tone shifts to one of resignation and hopelessness ("all we can do is pray...")
