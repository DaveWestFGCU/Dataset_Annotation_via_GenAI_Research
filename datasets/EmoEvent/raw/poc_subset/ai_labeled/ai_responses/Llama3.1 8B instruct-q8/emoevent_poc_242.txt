Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is discussing a sports game and a specific play.
* The tone of the statement is observational rather than evaluative or emotive.
* There is no explicit expression of negative emotions such as anger, disgust, or sadness.

Given these considerations, it's likely that the author is simply stating a fact about a previous game without any strong emotional attachment. However, since the author might be recalling a frustrating moment in the past, they could be experiencing some level of frustration or disappointment, which falls under **anger**.
