Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author mentions "sports gambling" as a separate entity from happiness.
* The phrase "THEN we'll be happy" implies that the current situation is not desirable or satisfactory.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is: **sadness**. The author suggests that only after achieving their goal (sports gambling) will they be happy, implying that they are currently unhappy or dissatisfied with their circumstances.

Important points to consider:

* The tweet is a response to something that has not been mentioned in the text.
* The author implies that there is still something missing or incomplete.
* The tone is casual and somewhat humorous.

Given these considerations, it seems that the author intends to convey **anger**, as they seem frustrated with the current state of things and are implying that sports gambling will somehow make them happy (i.e., address their frustration).
