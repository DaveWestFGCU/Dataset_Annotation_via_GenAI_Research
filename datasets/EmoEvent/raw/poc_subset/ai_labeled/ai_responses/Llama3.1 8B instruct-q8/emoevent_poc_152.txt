Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is expressing skepticism about a particular claim or idea.
* They are questioning the accuracy of something, specifically referencing a "shadowy military organization".
* There is no overtly positive or negative language used.

Based on these points, it seems that the author is expressing a neutral tone with a hint of **disgust**, likely due to the suspicious nature of the shadowy organization mentioned. However, disgust is not a perfect fit as there is no strong emotional language indicating revulsion or distaste. A more suitable option would be that the author is expressing skepticism and potentially annoyance at the claim, which leans towards **anger**.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author is responding to a specific statement or claim made by someone else.
* They are expressing skepticism and doubt about the accuracy of this claim.
* The phrase "shadowy military organizations" implies a sense of secrecy and potentially illicit activity, which may contribute to the tone.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**skepticism/anger is not explicitly present, but annoyance/disgust might be underlying; however, the primary sentiment conveyed appears to be more related to surprise or skepticism at the claim made by the other person.**

However, since I'm required to choose one and given that **surprise** seems like a more fitting response in this context, considering the author's tone of correcting an assumption or pointing out inaccuracy.

**surprise**
