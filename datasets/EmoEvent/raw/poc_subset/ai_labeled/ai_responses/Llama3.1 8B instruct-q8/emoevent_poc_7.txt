Response 3:
To classify this tweet, let's consider the following points:

* The tone is questioning and incredulous.
* The language used is a clear expression of skepticism or doubt.
* There is no indication of a positive emotional state (such as joy) or a negative one that would be intense enough to be categorized under anger.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label for this tweet is:

**disgust**

Note: While disgust typically implies something is repulsive or offensive, in this context, it's more likely that "You can't be serious" is used to express a strong sense of incredulity or annoyance, which might not be fully captured by the other options. However, given the available categories and considering the tone of the statement, **disgust** seems like the closest match.
