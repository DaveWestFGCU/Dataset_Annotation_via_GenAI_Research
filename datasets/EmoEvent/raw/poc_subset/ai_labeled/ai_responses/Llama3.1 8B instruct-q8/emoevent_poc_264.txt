Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author uses an exclamation mark at the end of the sentence, which can indicate strong emotions such as surprise or annoyance.
* The phrase "Maaan o man" appears to be a mocking expression, suggesting that the author is not genuinely congratulatory.
* The tone of the tweet seems sarcastic and dismissive.

Based on these points, I would classify the emotion as **disgust**. The author's sarcastic tone and mocking expression suggest that they are disapproving or disgusted by the other guy's comment.
