Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author expresses a negative sentiment about the lack of sound.
* They use humor ("lol") to soften their tone.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **surprise**.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet expresses a sentiment about something being negative ("a shame")
* However, it is followed by a humorous tone indicator ("lol") that suggests the author is not seriously upset
* The phrase "there is no sound" implies a lack or absence of something, which could be neutral or even positive in certain contexts

Given these points, I would classify the tweet as:

**surprise**
 
The humor and lighthearted tone ("lol") suggest that the author is more surprised by the situation than anything else. The phrase "it's a shame" is a figure of speech used to express mild disappointment or irony, rather than genuine anger or sadness.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The author is expressing a negative sentiment about a lack.
* The use of "shame" implies a sense of disappointment or regret.
* The phrase "lol" suggests that the author is attempting to be humorous or lighthearted.

Most relevant emotion label: **sadness**

The tone of the tweet seems to convey a sense of mild disappointment or melancholy, rather than any other strong emotions. The use of "shame" implies a negative emotional state, but it's not intense enough to categorize as anger or disgust. There's no indication of fear, joy, or surprise in the language used.
