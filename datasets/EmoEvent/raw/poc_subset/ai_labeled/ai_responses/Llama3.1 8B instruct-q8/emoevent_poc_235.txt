Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author mentions something negative about a situation (being silent for three-quarters of the game).
* However, they also express appreciation for the dedication involved.
* The tone seems to be more focused on the negative aspect than the positive.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**disappointment**, but since that's not an option, I'll choose a close alternative: **anger**.

* The author mentions a negative aspect (being silent for 3/4 of the game) and qualifies it with an appreciation for the dedication.
* The tone is critical, but not extreme or aggressive.

Most relevant emotion label: **disgust**. The author seems to be mildly disapproving or unimpressed by the team's performance, despite acknowledging their efforts.
