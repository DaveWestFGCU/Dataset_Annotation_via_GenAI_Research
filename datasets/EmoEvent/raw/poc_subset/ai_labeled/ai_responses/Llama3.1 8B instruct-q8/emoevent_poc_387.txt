Response 3:
To classify the tweet, let's consider the following points:

* The author mentions "rejecting" something, implying a strong stance or disagreement.
* They also mention doing something "separately", which suggests a sense of necessity or obligation rather than enthusiasm.
* There is no language that suggests excitement, positivity, or warmth.

Given these points, it appears the author has a negative tone. While there isn't any explicit emotion expressed (e.g., an exclamation mark or a word like "hate"), the context and choice of words suggest the author feels compelled to take action despite not being enthusiastic about it.

**anger**

Note: The tone is somewhat forced, but it's difficult to pinpoint an exact emotion without more context. However, considering the negative tone and sense of obligation, anger seems the most plausible label among the options provided.
