Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author mentions that there will always be someone taking advantage of the system, implying frustration or dissatisfaction.
* However, they follow this statement by expressing their continued willingness to help others who genuinely need assistance, indicating that their emotions are not entirely negative.

Given these considerations, I would classify the emotion as **sadness**.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author is expressing frustration or disappointment with the fact that there will always be someone abusing the system.
* The use of "always" emphasizes the author's certainty and exasperation about this issue.
* Despite their frustration, the author mentions still donating food to help others in need.

Given these points, the author's intended emotion appears to be **anger**, as they are expressing frustration and annoyance with the situation.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The author mentions that they donate food to help others in need.
* They express frustration with the idea of someone "gaming the system" and imply that it is a recurring problem.
* However, instead of letting this frustration stop them from helping others, they continue to make donations.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**anger**

The author's tone suggests annoyance or frustration at the situation, but their continued action of donating food indicates that this anger does not dominate their emotional response.
