Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author expresses frustration with the current situation involving parents, coaches, and referees.
* They imply that there is a lack of accountability and fairness.
* The tone is informal and conversational.

Most relevant emotion label: **anger**. The author's use of "Nothings better" (typo for "Nothing's better") suggests a strong negative sentiment towards the situation, indicating anger rather than another emotion.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author mentions "nothings better", which suggests a positive sentiment.
* However, they express frustration with various individuals involved in the context of a sporting event (teams, parents, coaches, and a referee).
* The use of all-caps letters for "just those people" implies a sense of exasperation or annoyance.

Given these points, I would categorize the emotion as: **anger**.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The author is criticizing the behavior of multiple individuals (coaches, referee, lawyers) in the context of a sports game.
* The tone seems negative and critical, with the use of "no good" to describe the coaches and referee.

Based on these points, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**. The author appears to be frustrated and annoyed by the behavior of those involved in the game.
