Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the tweet appears to be matter-of-fact and informative.
* The language used is straightforward and lacks emotional intensity.
* The author presents a calculation or comparison, which may indicate a neutral or objective tone.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is **neutrality does not appear to fit any of the provided categories**, but if I had to choose from the given options, I would say:

**surprise**
 
This is because the author presents a calculation that seems to be pointing out an unexpected or counterintuitive fact about the size and calorie count of a drink. The tone is more observational than emotional, which aligns with surprise as a neutral emotion that still acknowledges something unusual.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet appears to be a straightforward calculation of the calorie count in a drink.
* There are no emotional or sensational language used.

Given these points, I would classify the emotion as **disgust**. The tone of the tweet is matter-of-fact and neutral, but since disgust is often used to convey a lack of enthusiasm or interest, it's the most fitting label in this context.
