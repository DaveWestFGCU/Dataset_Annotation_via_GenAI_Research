Response 1:
The tone of this tweet is observational and matter-of-fact. The language used does not contain emotional adjectives or vivid imagery that would suggest strong emotions.

The author presents their opinion as a reasonable consideration in the context of current events, implying a sense of neutrality rather than enthusiasm or outrage.

There are no indicators of personal experience or strong feelings related to the topic.

No strong emotional language is used to describe past experiences with sexual harassment.

**joy**

Note: While it's possible that the author might be pleased with this consideration, their tone suggests more of a neutral observation. However, among the given options, joy is the closest fit due to the presence of "smart thing to do", which has a slightly positive connotation.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:
* The author is discussing a serious topic (sexual harassment) and implying that taking action is a prudent decision.
* There is no overtly positive or celebratory tone.
* The phrase "it seems like the smart thing to do" suggests a sense of consideration and thoughtfulness.

Given these considerations, the tweet likely conveys a sense of:
**prudence** isn't an option in the list, but I can infer that the author's tone is not strongly positive or joyful; instead, it's more measured. However, based on the options available, the closest fit would be:

* The author's tone is serious and cautionary, rather than angry or fearful.
* There is no indication of disgust or disinterest.
* The tone does not convey a sense of sadness or loss.

Surprise might seem like an option, but it doesn't quite fit. Therefore, considering the options provided:
**surprise**

However, given that this emotion category can sometimes include distraction and amazement, which may not be perfectly fitting here, I'll choose another label from the list:

Given that "surprise" is a somewhat broad and subjective choice in this context, an alternative option might be to consider "anger" in its broader sense. The author's tone does convey some level of frustration or disappointment with the current state of awareness about sexual harassment.

Considering these points:
**anger**

But considering the options more carefully, I think **disgust** (or disinterest) could be an overextension. There is no clear indication that the author feels this way.

Taking a step back and re-evaluating, since "surprise" might not have been the best choice in hindsight:
Considering all of these points, I would argue that:

**anger**

This is because the tone seems to convey frustration with how little has changed regarding awareness about sexual harassment, but without being overtly outraged or aggressive.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The author is reflecting on a specific issue (sexual harassment) that has gained widespread attention.
* They are framing this issue in relation to what they consider "the smart thing to do," implying a value judgment or expectation.

Given these considerations, the author's tone appears to be calm and matter-of-fact, without any obvious emotional arousal. The phrase "to me" also suggests a sense of personal opinion rather than strong emotion.

**sadness** is not relevant here, as there is no indication that the author is reflecting on a loss or expressing empathy for victims.
 
No other emotions in the list are strongly supported by this text either.
