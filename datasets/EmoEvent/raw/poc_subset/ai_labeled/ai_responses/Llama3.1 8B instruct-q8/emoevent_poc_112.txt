Response 1:
Important points to consider:
* The tweet is a proverb or saying.
* It expresses a universal truth about gravity.
* There's no indication of strong emotions.

Given the text and considering these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**surprise**
 
This classification makes sense because the tweet presents an observation that is surprising or counterintuitive to some people, but it does not necessarily convey a strong emotional tone.

- It does not express a personal experience or opinion.
- It presents a general truth without emotional tone.

**surprise**

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet is a common idiom that expresses a universal truth.
* It does not contain any emotive language or personal experience.
* It lacks a clear emotional tone.

Based on the above analysis, there is no indication of a specific emotion being conveyed in this tweet. However, considering it's a neutral statement, I would say:

**surprise**

The reason for choosing surprise is that the phrase "What goes up must come down" is often used to convey a sense of inevitability or a universal truth, which can sometimes have a subtle effect of surprising people with its simplicity and accuracy. However, this emotion label is not strongly implied in this case, and it's more of an interpretation than a direct expression of the author's intention.
