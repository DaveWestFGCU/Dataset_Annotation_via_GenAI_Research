Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The author uses the phrase "Well, quite", which can be a somewhat dismissive or exasperated expression.
* They state that they are now "all annoyed", explicitly expressing their emotional state.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**anger**

Note that while annoyance is closely related to anger, it's distinct in intensity and connotation. However, in this context, the author's tone suggests a stronger underlying sentiment of anger rather than mere annoyance.
