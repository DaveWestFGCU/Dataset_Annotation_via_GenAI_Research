Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is making a comment about modern art.
* They use the phrase "looks like" which implies a neutral or observational tone.
* They also use the phrase "tbh" (to be honest), which suggests that they are sharing their genuine opinion.
* However, they immediately follow this with "but its good", indicating that despite their initial reservations, they actually have a positive opinion of the art.

Given these points, it appears that the author is expressing surprise or a mild shock at how much they like something that they initially thought was just modern art. The use of the word "good" after an initial negative implication (comparing it to modern art) creates a sense of unexpected pleasantness.

**surprise**

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author uses a dismissive phrase ("Looks like modern art") which implies a sense of familiarity with and possibly distaste for the subject matter.
* The use of "tbh" (to be honest) suggests that the author is expressing an opinion in a casual, conversational tone.
* The word "good" at the end of the tweet implies a positive assessment.

Given these points, I would classify the emotion as **disgust**. Despite expressing a positive opinion about the subject matter, the dismissive and somewhat sarcastic tone suggests that the author is not necessarily enthusiastic or impressed, but rather resigned to appreciating something they don't fully understand or enjoy.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The author is expressing a seemingly contradictory opinion about modern art.
* They mention that it "looks" like something, but then qualify their statement with "but its good", suggesting that despite its appearance, the artwork has merit.

Given these considerations, I would classify the tweet as:

**surprise**
 
The author's tone suggests that they are taken aback by the quality of a piece of art that appears to be in line with the typical expectations of modern art.
