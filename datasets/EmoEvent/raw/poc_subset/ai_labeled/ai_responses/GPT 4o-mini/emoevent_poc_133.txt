Response 1:
Important points to consider:
- The tweet mentions voting and polls, which typically indicates a discussion around opinions or preferences.
- There is no explicit expression of strong feelings like anger or disgust.
- The tone seems neutral and observational rather than emotionally charged.
- The use of "tends to" suggests a habitual observation, which may imply some degree of annoyance but is not strongly stated.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is **disgust**.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:
- The tweet mentions the behavior of one person in relation to another regarding polling, which indicates a potential competitive or confrontational context.
- There is no explicit expression of positive feelings or happiness; the focus is more on a statement of fact rather than an emotional outburst.

Response 3:
To classify the emotion conveyed in the tweet, consider the following points:

1. The tweet appears to describe a political or competitive context, likely referring to preferences in polls or votes.
2. The use of "tends to" suggests a repeated observation rather than a strong emotional reaction.
3. There is no explicit indication of positive or negative feelings, such as joy or anger.
4. The nature of the statement seems more observational and factual, rather than expressing a strong emotional response.

Based on these points, the emotion that best fits the author's intention in this context is neutral, but it leans toward **disgust** due to a potential underlying disinterest or dislike in the context of polling outcomes or rivalry.

Thus, the relevant emotion label is **disgust**.
