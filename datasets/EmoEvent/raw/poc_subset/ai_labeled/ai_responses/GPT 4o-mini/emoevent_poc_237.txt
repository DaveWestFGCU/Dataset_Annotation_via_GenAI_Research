Response 2:
Important points to consider:
- The use of "shame" may indicate a sense of disappointment or annoyance.
- The addition of "lol" suggests that the author is trying to lighten the tone, which may indicate they are not overly upset but still register some level of dissatisfaction.
- Overall, the sentiment seems to reflect a mild annoyance rather than a deep-seated anger or strong negative emotion.

Based on these points, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:
- The phrase "It’s a shame" indicates a sense of disappointment or regret.
- The use of "lol" (laugh out loud) suggests a lighthearted tone despite the disappointment.
- The author's intent may not be deeply negative, as the laughing part could imply they are taking the situation lightly.

Considering these points, the most relevant emotion appears to be a mild disappointment but framed in a humorous way, which doesn't strongly align with any of the categories like anger or sadness, but leans slightly toward **disgust** due to the implied dislike for the lack of sound. However, since it doesn’t strongly evoke a sense of loathing or disinterest, and given the humor involved, categorizing this becomes more nuanced. 

Nevertheless, the presence of shame does elevate a kind of discontent.

Thus, the response is **disgust**.
