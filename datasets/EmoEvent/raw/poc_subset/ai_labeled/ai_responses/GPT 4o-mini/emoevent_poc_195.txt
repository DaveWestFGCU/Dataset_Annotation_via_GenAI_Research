Response 1:
Important points to consider:
- The tweet presents numerical information regarding caloric content.
- There is no emotional language present in the tweet.
- The style is neutral and informative, focusing on facts rather than personal feelings or reactions.
- The mention of calories might suggest concern over food choices, but there is no expression of distress or negativity.

Based on these points, the emotion this tweet most closely relates to is neutral, but since we need to classify it among the provided emotions, the closest fit would be **disgust** due to a lack of enthusiasm or positive sentiment expressed towards the subject of calories. However, it's crucial to note that it is not overtly disgusted, implying possible disinterest.

Thus, the most relevant emotion label is **disgust**.

Response 2:
Important points to consider from the text: 
- The tweet presents nutritional information regarding calories.
- It appears to be a factual statement rather than expressing a personal emotion or sentiment.
- There is no indication of strong emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise in this context.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label would be **disgust** since it suggests a neutral or negative sentiment about calorie content, possibly indicating disinterest or dislike towards high-calorie items. However, the primary tone remains factual and could also indicate neutral observation. 

Thus, the best fitting label from a strict emotional framework is **disgust**.
