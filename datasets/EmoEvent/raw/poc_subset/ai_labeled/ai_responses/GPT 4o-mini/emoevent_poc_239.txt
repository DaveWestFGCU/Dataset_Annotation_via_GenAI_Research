Response 1:
When analyzing the tweet, several key points arise:

1. The use of "I like it" indicates a positive sentiment, which might suggest joy or approval.
2. The phrase "I just wish" conveys an element of desire for improvement, which can imply mild frustration or annoyance concerning the specific detail mentioned (the m and apostrophe).
3. The tone does not reflect strong negative feelings but rather expresses a constructive critique of something the author appreciates.

Taking these points into consideration, the emotion most relevant to the tweet appears to be a blend of positive acknowledgment with a hint of annoyance regarding the specifics.

1. **Expression of Affection**: The phrase "I like it" indicates a positive sentiment towards something, which suggests an underlying sense of appreciation or joy.
2. **Wish for Change**: The author expresses a desire for improvement ("I just wish he’d drop the m and apostrophe"), which hints at a level of annoyance or irritation, but it's not predominantly negative.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

1. The author expresses a positive opinion ("I like it") indicating some level of enjoyment or satisfaction.
2. However, there is a clear wish for improvement regarding a specific detail (“he’d drop the m and apostrophe”), suggesting a degree of annoyance or frustration with that element.
3. The combination of liking something while also wishing it were different could imply a mild irritation but not extreme negativity.

Based on these points, the most relevant emotion conveyed is a form of annoyance rather than outright anger or joy.
