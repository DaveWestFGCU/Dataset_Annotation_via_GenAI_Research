Response 3:
Important points to consider given the text:
- The use of "fan" suggests a level of enthusiasm or interest in a sports context, possibly implying a sense of loyalty or attachment to a team or player.
- The phrase "He did trade" indicates a transaction that likely affects the author's sentiment towards the situation.
- The mention of specific years (2018 and 2019) and the terminology (4th and 7th round picks) suggests familiarity with sports trading, which can evoke a range of emotions depending on whether the trade was viewed positively or negatively.
