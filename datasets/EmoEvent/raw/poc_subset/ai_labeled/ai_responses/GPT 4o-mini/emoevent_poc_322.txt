Response 1:
To classify the emotion intended in the tweet "Who wrote the IQ tests?", we should consider the following points:

1. **Curiosity**: The question poses a sense of wondering, which could indicate a desire for knowledge or understanding about the origins of IQ tests. This may suggest an element of surprise or confusion about the topic.
2. **Skepticism**: The phrasing of the question could imply a critical perspective on the validity or fairness of IQ tests, perhaps questioning their nature or intent.
3. **Neutral Tone**: The tweet does not contain any strong emotional indicators like exclamation marks or emotive language, suggesting a straightforward inquiry rather than an emotional outburst.

Given these considerations, while the curiosity could lean towards surprise, the tone seems more critical, pointing towards skepticism regarding the credibility of IQ tests. However, as the primary content is a mere question without any strong negative emotions or dissatisfaction expressed, it doesn't fit neatly into categories like anger or disgust.

Since this tweet seems to probe into the foundations of an established idea (IQ tests) and suggests some level of disbelief or scrutiny while maintaining neutrality, the best fit would ultimately lean toward **surprise** due to the nature of the inquiry about a widely accepted construct. 

Thus, the most relevant emotion label is **surprise**.
