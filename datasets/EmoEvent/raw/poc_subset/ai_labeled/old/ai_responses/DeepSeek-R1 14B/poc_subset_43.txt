Alright, so I need to figure out what emotion the author of this tweet is conveying. The tweet is about World Book Day and mentions ten memorable scenes from Hindi cinema where books play a starring role. There are two hashtags: #WorldBookDay and another one with a link that probably leads to more content.

First, I'll look at the structure of the tweet. It's sharing information related to a specific event, which is World Book Day. The mention of memorable scenes from Hindi cinema suggests an interest in literature and film, maybe even nostalgia. The links likely provide additional resources or articles about books in movies.

Considering the list of emotions provided: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to determine which one applies here. Let's analyze each option.

1. **Anger/annoyance/rage**: There's no indication of negative feelings here. The tweet is informative and positive.

2. **Disgust/disinterest/dislike/loathe**: Again, nothing suggests any dislike or aversion. It's more about celebration rather than criticism.

3. **Fear/apprehension/anxiety/terror**: No elements of fear are present in the content.

4. **Joy/serenity/ecstasy**: The tweet is celebrating World Book Day and highlighting the role of books in cinema, which sounds like a positive and uplifting message. It's likely the author wants to share something enjoyable related to literature and movies.

5. **Sadness/pensiveness/grief**: There's no sadness here; it's more about celebration.

6. **Surprise/distraction/amazement**: While the mention of books in cinema might be surprising to some, I don't think that's the primary emotion conveyed. It's more informative than surprising.

Putting it all together, the tweet seems intended to share interesting and positive information related to World Book Day. The use of a hashtag like #WorldBookDay suggests an attempt to engage others in celebrating books, which aligns with joy or positivity.
