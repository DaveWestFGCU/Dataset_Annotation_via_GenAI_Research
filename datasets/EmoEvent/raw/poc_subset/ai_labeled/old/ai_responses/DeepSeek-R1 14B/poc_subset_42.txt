Alright, let's break down this tweet. The user is talking about Messi, who they refer to as only the 5th best player in the world, which seems a bit of an underestimation given his reputation. They mention that he's gone and "fucked" Liverpool, using a strong verb here. The emojis used are 🤷🏻♂️ which is a shrug, often indicating surprise or disbelief, and 😆 which is a laughing emoji, suggesting amusement.

Looking at the sentiment, the user seems to be expressing both surprise and humor. The word "only" could imply that Messi's performance was unexpected but impressive enough to affect Liverpool negatively. The laughter emoji adds a layer of amusement or perhaps sarcastic delight in Messi's impact on Liverpool.

Considering the emotion options, surprise fits because the tweet is about an unexpected event (Messi causing trouble) and the shrug emoji emphasizes that. While there might be some frustration or disappointment from Liverpool's perspective, the primary emotions conveyed are surprise and humor.

Alright, so I need to figure out what emotion the author of this tweet is conveying. The options are Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, or Surprise.

First, looking at the content: the tweet says "Only the 5th best player in the world has gone and fucked Liverpool." That's a bit harsh—using "fucked" here is strong language, which might imply frustration or anger. But then there's an emoji with raised hands and a smiley face (🤷🏻♂️😆). The raised hand could indicate surrender or disbelief, while the smiley suggests something positive.

The hashtags are #championsleague and #messi, which points to Messi being involved in the Champions League. So maybe Messi scored against Liverpool? That would make sense because the author is talking about a top player affecting the team negatively.

Putting it together: The author seems frustrated that even though Messi is ranked 5th, he still managed to impact Liverpool's game. But with the emojis, there's a mix of negative and positive feelings. The smiley might indicate amusement or mild surprise rather than pure anger.

So considering all this, while "fucked" sounds angry, the overall tone isn't purely angry because of the happy emoji. It could be more about the surprising twist or frustration but not necessarily full-blown anger. However, given that "fucking" is a strong term, maybe it's still leaning towards Anger.

Wait, but the smiley and raised hand might also convey a sense of defeat or amusement rather than pure anger. Alternatively, if the author is surprised by Messi's impact despite being 5th, that could be Surprise.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between Anger and Surprise here. The use of strong language suggests Anger, but the emojis add another layer.

The emotion conveyed in the tweet is primarily **Anger**, as indicated by the strong language used. However, the inclusion of emojis adds an element of amusement or mild surprise, but the dominant sentiment remains Anger.

**Answer: 1. Anger**

Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion conveyed. The user wrote, "Only the 5th best player in the world has gone and fucked Liverpool 🤷🏻♂️😆 #championsleague #messi." 

First, I notice they're mentioning Messi, who is widely regarded as one of the best players in the world, often ranked higher than 5th. The phrase "Only the 5th best player" might be a way to downplay his abilities or perhaps sarcastically point out that even someone of lower rank (though unlikely) could impact Liverpool.

The emojis used are 🤷♂️ and 😆. The shrug emoji typically indicates surprise, doubt, or disbelief, while the haha face suggests amusement or laughter. 

Putting it together, the user seems to be expressing a mix of surprise and sarcasm. They're probably reacting humorously to Messi's performance against Liverpool, perhaps surprised that even someone so highly ranked could have such an effect. The tone isn't negative like anger or disgust; instead, it's more about the unexpected outcome with a touch of sarcasm.

So, considering all this, the emotion here is surprise.

The tweet expresses **Surprise** due to the sarcastic and humorous reaction to Messi's impact on Liverpool in the Champions League.
