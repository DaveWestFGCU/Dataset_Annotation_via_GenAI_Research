Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. The user wrote, "About damn time. Good luck and godspeed to those representing sanity in #Venezuela today!" 

First, let me break down the words here. "About damn time" sounds like someone is expressing relief or satisfaction that something has finally happened. It could be frustration turning into a positive feeling because maybe things are moving in the right direction.

Then, they wish good luck and godspeed to those representing sanity. That part seems supportive and hopeful. They're acknowledging people who are trying to bring stability or sense to the situation.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: If it's about relief or satisfaction after a long time, that might fall under joy because it's a positive feeling. Alternatively, if there's frustration, it could be anger, but in this case, the overall tone seems more hopeful and supportive rather than angry.

So considering all that, I think the primary emotion here is joy because they're expressing relief and support in a positive way.
