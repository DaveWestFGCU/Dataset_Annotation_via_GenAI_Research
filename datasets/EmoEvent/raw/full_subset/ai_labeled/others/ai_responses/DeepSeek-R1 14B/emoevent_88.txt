Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says, "I'll go with next team to score wins it... #ChampionsLeague #Tottenham #AjaxTottenham." 

First, let's break down the content. The user is talking about a football match, probably between Tottenham and Ajax given the hashtags. They're saying they'll go with the next team to score as the winner. This sounds like they're making a prediction or expressing their stance on who might win.

Now, considering emotions: Is there any indication of strong feelings here? The tweet is pretty neutral. It's more of an announcement or a statement rather than expressing happiness, anger, or surprise. There's no explicit language showing excitement, frustration, or any other emotion.

Looking at the hashtags, they're just tagging the event and teams involved, which doesn't add much emotional context. The user isn't using any emojis or exclamation marks to convey feelings either.

So, based on the guidelines, if there's no clear emotion expressed, or it's more about stating a fact without showing any particular feeling, we classify it as 'other'. There's no dominant emotion here; it's just an informative statement.
