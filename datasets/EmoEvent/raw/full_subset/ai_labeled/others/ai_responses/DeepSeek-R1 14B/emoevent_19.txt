Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. The tweet says: "I am sure Elliot Abrams can explain you that, with the right resources, democracy can be defeated - it usually is, in fact, a testament to US power and capacity. #Venezuela https://t.co/Ugv5quKpkU"

First, I'll break down the content. The author mentions Elliot Abrams, who's known for his role in U.S. foreign policy, especially regarding Latin America. They're suggesting that with resources, democracy can be defeated, implying that it often is, and they see this as a testament to US power.

The tone here seems critical or cynical about how the U.S. influences other countries' politics. The use of words like "defeated" and "testament to US power" suggests frustration or skepticism towards the U.S.'s role in Venezuela's crisis.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger is about annoyance or rage, disgust is for dislike or disinterest, fear is apprehension, joy is positive feelings, sadness is pensiveness, surprise is amazement, and other if none fit.

The tweet doesn't express happiness, fear, or surprise. It's more about frustration with U.S. influence, which aligns with anger. The author seems annoyed or upset about the situation, pointing out what they see as misuse of power.
