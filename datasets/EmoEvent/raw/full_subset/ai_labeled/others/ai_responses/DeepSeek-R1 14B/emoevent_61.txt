Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says: "Final ever scene of GoT will be Bran Stark sitting on the throne, rolling his eyes *zooms in on eyes* they roll back down bright blue #GameOfThrones #GoT". 

First, I'll break it down. The user is talking about the final scene of Game of Thrones, which was a big deal because the series finale was quite controversial and didn't go over well with many fans. They describe Bran sitting on the throne and rolling his eyes, with a zoom in on his bright blue eyes.

Now, thinking about emotions here. The mention of the "final ever scene" might evoke nostalgia or sadness for the end of something significant. However, the way it's described—Bran rolling his eyes and the focus on his eyes—could imply a sense of indifference or maybe even a bit of annoyance. But I'm not sure if that's the primary emotion.

Wait, but the user is sharing this as a fact about how the final scene will be, so maybe they're just stating it without expressing their own feelings. The hashtags are just for categorization. So perhaps there's no strong emotion here; it's more of an informative tweet or a fan theory.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: if the tweet conveys no emotion, multiple emotions with no dominant one, or more context is needed, classify as 'other'. In this case, the tweet doesn't express any clear emotion. It's more about describing a scene rather than expressing feelings. So I think the appropriate classification here would be 'other'.
