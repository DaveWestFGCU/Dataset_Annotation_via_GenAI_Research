Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Champions League match. Let me read through it carefully.

The tweet starts with "#ChampionsLeague Leg 1 @ #CampNou" which tells me it's talking about a specific game at Camp Nou stadium. Then it says "#Liverpool played like the old #Barcelona but it was #FCBarcelona the one that got the victory." So Liverpool is being compared to an older version of Barcelona, but in the end, FC Barcelona won.

The next part mentions "Effectiveness at its top #Messi, always…" which clearly highlights Messi's performance. The use of words like "effectiveness" and "always" suggests admiration for Messi's play.

Now, thinking about emotions: The author is talking about a match where Barcelona won, especially praising Messi. There's no negative language here; instead, it seems positive. Words like "victory," "effectiveness," and the mention of Messi in a favorable light all point towards a positive emotion.

Looking at the options, joy would fit because the tweet expresses satisfaction or happiness about the outcome and the performance. There's no sign of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise—just celebration of a win and a player's skill.
