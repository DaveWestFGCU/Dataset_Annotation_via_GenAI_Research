Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion. The user starts with "Literally was not ready for this episode ðŸ˜±", which uses a shocked emoji and expresses surprise about the episode. Then they praise Arya Stark as an absolute hero with a broken heart emoji ðŸ–¤, showing strong positive feelings towards her character.

The context is Game of Thrones, a show known for its intense plot twists. The mention of "BattleOfWinterfell" suggests a significant event in the series. The user's reaction combines surprise at the episode's content and admiration for Arya Stark, indicating both shock and joy.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger doesn't fit because there's no indication of frustration or rage. Disgust isn't present either; instead, there's praise. Fear is not applicable here since the tweet isn't expressing anxiety or terror. Sadness isn't the primary emotion either, as the user is expressing positive feelings towards Arya.

The key emotions are surprise from the shocked reaction and joy from praising Arya Stark. However, the primary emotion conveyed seems to be surprise because of the explicit use of the ðŸ˜± emoji and the exclamation about not being ready for the episode. While there's joy in their praise, the initial and more prominent reaction is surprise.

So, considering all this, the best fit would be "surprise."
