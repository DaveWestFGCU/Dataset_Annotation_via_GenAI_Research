Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let me read it carefully.

The user starts with "Watch Agree," which might be a typo or an abbreviation for something like "I agree" or "Let me see." Then they mention that the BBC's higher management has acted as puppets of corporate interests by undermining the #XR, #FridaysForFuture, and #GretaThunberg movement. They end with saying it's time for a clearout of these self-serving parasites.

Breaking this down, the user is talking about the BBC's actions against environmental movements led by Greta Thunberg. The words used are strong: "puppets," "undermine," "self-serving parasites." These terms show frustration and anger towards those in power who are opposing the movement.

The overall tone seems critical and upset. They're not just stating an opinion but expressing strong disapproval. Words like "clearout" suggest a desire for change, which can come from feelings of anger or frustration.

I don't see any signs of joy, fear, or surprise here. The emotion is more about opposition and irritation towards the BBC's stance. So, the primary emotion conveyed is likely anger.
