Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet: "I will write my favourite book. #WorldBookDay". Let me break it down step by step.

First, the context is World Book Day, which is about promoting reading and books. The tweet says the author will write their favorite book. Hmm, writing a favorite book sounds like they're expressing interest or enthusiasm in literature.

The emotion mapping guidelines say to look for primary emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or other. So I need to see which one fits here.

"I will write my favourite book." The use of "will" indicates determination or a plan. Expressing that they'll write their favorite book could show excitement or happiness about engaging with something they loveâ€”books. That sounds like joy because it's about doing something enjoyable and positive.

There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or sadness. It's more about participation in a literary event, which is a positive thing. The hashtag also supports that it's related to celebrating books, so the emotion is likely positive.

So putting it all together, the primary emotion here seems to be joy because they're expressing eagerness and happiness about writing their favorite book on World Book Day.
