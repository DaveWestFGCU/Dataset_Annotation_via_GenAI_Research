Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet by Greta Thunberg. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet starts with "EXACTLY!!!", which shows excitement or agreement. Then she mentions several hashtags related to climate change and her movement, like #ClimateChange, #FridayForFuture, and others. She's clearly passionate about these topics.

She says, "Bernie, forget about ANITHING ELSE! This is everything This is life and death." The use of all caps for "EXACTLY" and the emphasis on "life and death" indicates a strong emotional response. It sounds like she's urging action because she sees this as critical to survival.

The word "peace" at the end might seem neutral, but given the context, it probably refers to wanting peace through addressing climate issues rather than calmness.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger is about annoyance or rage; disgust is for dislike; fear is apprehension; joy is serenity; sadness is pensiveness; surprise is distraction or amazement. Her message isn't expressing any of these directly. Instead, she's emphasizing urgency and importance, which might not fit neatly into one of the primary emotions listed.

Wait, but maybe it's closer to anger because she's urging action strongly, almost scolding Bernie to focus on this issue. Alternatively, it could be fear if she's talking about life and death as a serious threat. But I think the primary emotion here is more about urgency and passion rather than fear or anger specifically.

But according to the guidelines, if it's not fitting into any of the main categories, we classify it as "other." However, her tone does convey strong concern, which might be closer to fear because she's talking about life and death. Alternatively, maybe it's more about sadness if she's highlighting a critical issue that needs attention.

Wait, but looking back, the primary emotion is likely fear because she's discussing something serious and urgent—climate breakdown—which can evoke fear of future consequences.
