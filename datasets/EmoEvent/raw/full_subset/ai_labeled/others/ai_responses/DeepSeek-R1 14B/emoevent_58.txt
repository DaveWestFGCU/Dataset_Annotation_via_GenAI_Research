Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The user is asking for a positive news article about Greta Thunberg specifically from someone who's actually autistic. They're thanking with a prayer emoji.

First, let me break down the content. The tweet is a request, not an expression of emotion per se. But I should consider the context given: Greta Thunberg is known for her climate activism and strikes. She's quite a polarizing figure; some people admire her, others criticize her.

The user is seeking a positive article from an autistic person. Why would that matter? Maybe they're looking for perspective from someone who shares a specific identity or viewpoint. The tone here seems hopeful or at least open to finding positivity.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, other. I need to see which fits best. There's no obvious sign of anger or disgust in the tweet. It's not expressing fear or sadness either. Surprise? Maybe if they're expecting something unusual, but that doesn't seem right.

The user is making a polite request, using "Thanks üôè", which is positive. They might be feeling hopeful about finding such an article, so maybe joy? Or perhaps it's neutral because it's more of a factual request without clear emotion.

But the guidelines say if there's no emotion or multiple emotions without a dominant one, classify as 'other'. Since this tweet is making a request rather than expressing an emotion, and it's not clear what emotion is intended, I think 'other' is appropriate.
