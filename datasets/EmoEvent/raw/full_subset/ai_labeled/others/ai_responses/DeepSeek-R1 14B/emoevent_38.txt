Alright, let's break down this tweet and figure out the emotion behind it. The user is talking about US diplomacy towards Venezuela being restrained but pointed. They give kudos to someone for an interview but then express concern about being seconds away from military action. They mention hoping we don't overreact and emphasize patience.

So, looking at the words used: "restrained," "pointed," "kudos," "interview," "military action," "overreact," "patience." The overall tone seems cautious but concerned. The user is worried about potential military action and wants to avoid overreaction, which suggests they're anxious or apprehensive.

Apprehension falls under the fear category because it's a feeling of worry or concern about something bad happening. Even though there are positive elements like giving kudos, the dominant emotion seems to be fear due to the mention of military action and overreaction.
