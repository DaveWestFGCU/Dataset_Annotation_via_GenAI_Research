Record: "USER USER USER That's not very nice, is it?!  So are they SURE the #NotreDameCathedralFire was not deliberately set - just careless accident due to malfunctioning equipment or illicit tags by that construt company?!"

Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is asking if it's "not very nice" and questioning whether the fire was deliberate or just an accident. They're expressing doubt and frustration.

First, looking at the words used: "That's not very nice" shows some disapproval. Then they ask if the fire was "surely" set deliberately, suggesting suspicion. The use of exclamation marks indicates strong feelings. 

The emotion here seems to be a mix of frustration and maybe even anger. They're questioning the official cause and implying that someone might have been careless or negligent. This could stem from anger towards those responsible or frustration with the situation.

I don't think it's disgust because they're not expressing dislike for something but rather frustration at the possible cause. Fear isn't present either; it's more about the reaction to the event. Sadness is there due to the tragedy, but the primary emotion seems to be frustration bordering on anger.

So, considering the guidelines, if it's similar to annoyance or rage, it should be classified as anger.
