Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says, "Last week Arya had us talking about her sex life. This week she had us talking about her killing skills. A girl contains multitudes! #GameofThrones." 

First, let me break down what's being said here. The author is mentioning two different aspects of Arya Stark: her personal life (sex life) and her violent tendencies (killing skills). Then they end with a humorous twist, saying "A girl contains multitudes!" which is a playful way to highlight that she has many facets to her personality.

The tone seems light-hearted and maybe even a bit amused. The use of humor suggests joy or at least a positive emotion. They're pointing out the contrast between Arya's different sides in a fun way, not expressing any negative feelings like anger or disgust. 

I don't detect any signs of fear, sadness, or surprise here. It's more about celebrating her character's depth with a smile. So, considering the options, joy seems to fit best because it captures the lighthearted and positive sentiment expressed in the tweet.
