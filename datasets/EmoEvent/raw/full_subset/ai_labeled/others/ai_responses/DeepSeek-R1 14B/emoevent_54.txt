Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The user provided a context about Venezuela's presidential crisis and then shared a tweet comparing the stability of different countries, mentioning Nordic Socialist States, rich countries, and specifically calling out Venezuela and the USA.

First, looking at the content: the tweet is talking about how stable various countries are, pointing out that Nordic countries are the most stable. It mentions Venezuela being in the bottom third and possibly dropping to the bottom 10. The USA is ranked 154th and going down. 

I don't see any explicit emotional words here. The tone seems factual or informative. The user isn't expressing happiness, anger, sadness, etc., but rather stating statistics and rankings. There's no indication of personal feelings or opinions beyond the information presented.

Since there's no clear emotion expressed—no positive or negative language—the tweet is more about presenting data. Therefore, according to the guidelines, if the tweet conveys no emotion or multiple emotions without a dominant one, it should be classified as 'other'.

The tweet presents factual information without expressing any emotion.
