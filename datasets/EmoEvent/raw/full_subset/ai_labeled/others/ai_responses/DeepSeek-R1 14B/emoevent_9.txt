Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let's break it down.

The tweet says: "Who else but #messi should score the league winning goal #LaLiga #Barca #BarcaLevante". 

First, looking at the hashtags, it's about La Liga, which is a top football league in Spain. The user is talking about Messi scoring the league-winning goal. So, they're probably expressing excitement or support for Messi and their team, Barcelona.

The phrase "Who else but #messi" suggests that the speaker believes Messi is the only one who should score such an important goal. This indicates a strong positive sentiment towards Messi's performance and impact on the game.

There are no negative words here. The emojis used (if any) would likely be celebratory, but since they aren't shown, I have to go off the text. The overall tone is enthusiastic and hopeful for Messi's success in the league.

So, considering the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or other. This seems like joy because it's expressing excitement and support.
