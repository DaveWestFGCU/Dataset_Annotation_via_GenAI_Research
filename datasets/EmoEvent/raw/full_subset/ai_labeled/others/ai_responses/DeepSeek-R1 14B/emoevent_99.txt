Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says, "Ref really allowing it physical today. Might benefit #liverpool. #ChampionsLeague." 

First, let's break down what's being said here. The user is talking about a referee (ref) who is letting physical play happen. They mention that this might benefit Liverpool, and they're using the Champions League hashtag.

The phrase "allowing it physical today" suggests that the referee isn't enforcing rules against rough play. So, the user seems to be pointing out that the game is getting physical, possibly in a way that's not being controlled by the officials. 

Now, how does this make the author feel? Well, if the ref isn't controlling physicality, it could lead to more aggressive or rough play, which might affect the game negatively. The user mentions that this might benefit Liverpool, so maybe they're implying that Liverpool could take advantage of the lenient refereeing. 

But what emotion does this convey? Is the author happy about this situation? Probably not. If the ref is allowing physicality, it's more likely to cause frustration or annoyance because it might lead to unfair advantages for certain teams or disrupt the game. So, the emotion here seems to be frustration or maybe even anger.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: if the tweet conveys an emotion similar to annoyance or rage, we classify it as anger. The user isn't explicitly stating they're angry, but their implication that the ref's decisions are benefiting Liverpool could indicate frustration with the refereeing decisions. 

Alternatively, is there a chance this is surprise? Maybe not, because the user seems to be pointing out something they might have anticipated or are reacting to negatively rather than being surprised.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion here is likely anger due to the frustration expressed about the referee's decisions.
