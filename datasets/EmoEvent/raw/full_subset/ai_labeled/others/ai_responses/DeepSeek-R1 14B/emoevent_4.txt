Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user is comparing what the show does with battle scenes and special effects to their own approach using narrative and compelling storylines at a lower cost.

First, let's break down the tweet: "What #GameofThrones does with battle scenes and special effects, the USER does with narrative and compelling story lines (at a fraction of the cost)." The user is highlighting their strength in storytelling compared to GoT's use of visuals. It sounds like they're proud or impressed by their own work.

The emotion here seems positive because they're complimenting their own abilities and achievements. They might be feeling satisfied or happy about being able to create engaging stories without relying heavily on expensive effects. There's no negative language, so it's not anger or disgust. No signs of fear or surprise either. It doesn't seem like sadness since the tone is upbeat.

So, considering the options, joy fits because they're expressing pride and satisfaction in their narrative skills. They're effectively communicating that their storytelling is on par with a high-budget show but done more economically, which is something to be happy about.
