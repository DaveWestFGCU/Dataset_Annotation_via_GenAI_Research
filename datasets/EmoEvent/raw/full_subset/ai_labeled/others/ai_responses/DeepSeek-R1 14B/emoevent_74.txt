Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral Fire. The tweet says, "Was the #NotreDameCathedralFire #NotreDame by design to incite a war?" 

First, let me understand what's being asked here. The user is suggesting that the fire at Notre Dame might have been intentional, possibly as a way to start a war. That's a pretty serious accusation.

Now, thinking about emotions, I need to classify this into one of anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or other. Let me go through each possibility.

Anger: The tweet is questioning the intentions behind the fire, which could imply frustration or irritation towards whoever might have caused it. But is that the primary emotion?

Disgust: Disgust usually involves feelings of revulsion or dislike. Maybe if someone feels disgusted by the idea, but I'm not sure that's the main feeling here.

Fear: Fear would be more about anxiety or dread. The tweet doesn't directly express fear; it's more about suspicion.

Joy: Definitely not, since the topic is a tragic event and the tweet is questioning intentions.

Sadness: While the fire was tragic, the tweet isn't expressing sadness but rather doubt or accusation.

Surprise: Surprise would be if something unexpected happened. The suggestion that the fire might have been intentional could be surprising, but again, I'm not sure it's the primary emotion.

Other: If none of the above fit, then 'other' is the category.

The tweet seems to be making a conspiracy theory or accusation, which might be more about frustration or anger towards those who might have done it. So maybe anger fits here because the author is upset or annoyed at the possibility that someone would do such a thing.

Alternatively, could it be disgust? If the author feels disgusted by the idea of someone intentionally causing such destruction, that's possible too. But I think anger is more likely because they're questioning motives and possibly blaming others, which can come from anger.

So after considering all options, I think the primary emotion here is anger.
