Alright, let's try to figure out the emotion in this tweet. The user is talking about Greta Thunberg and comparing her to Rosa Luxemburg, which I know was a historical figure involved in socialism and activism. They mention hashtags like #RosaLuxemburg, #revocablegovernment, and specific politicians like Trump, Macron, and Shell.

The tone seems critical or sarcastic towards Greta's approach. Words like "whine" suggest frustration with her methods. The user is questioning her strategy by mentioning a quota system and suggesting she should be more effective. There's also a link to an article, which might be pointing out something negative about her actions.

I'm thinking the emotion here isn't straightforward happiness or sadness but rather something like disgust or maybe anger. The use of "whine" indicates irritation, and the overall message seems to mock Greta's approach. However, since it's more about disapproval rather than outright anger, I might lean towards disgust because it often involves feelings of dislike or aversion.

But wait, could it be anger? The user is frustrated with her methods, so maybe that's a better fit. Anger usually involves irritation and a desire to change something. Dislike is more about disgust, but here the emotion seems directed at Greta's actions rather than a person per se.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between anger and disgust. The tweet expresses frustration with her approach, which could be seen as anger, but it's also expressing disapproval of her methods, which might lean towards disgust. However, since the primary emotion is more about irritation and criticism, maybe anger is more appropriate.

Wait, no, the user isn't attacking Greta personally but rather her tactics. So perhaps it's more frustration with her approach, which could be a form of anger. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider that the main emotion here is disgust because they're expressing dislike for how she's handling things.

Alternatively, maybe the tweet doesn't express any strong emotion and is just informative, but that seems unlikely given the tone. So between anger and disgust, I think anger might be more fitting because of the frustration and criticism implied.
