Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says, "Are we sure that Messi is human? #ChampionsLeague #GOAT." Hmm, let's break it down.

First, the mention of Messi and calling him into question about his humanity suggests admiration or disbelief. The hashtags are related to the Champions League and "Greatest Of All Time," which are positive references. So, the author seems impressed by Messi's skills, maybe even surprised at how extraordinary he is.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, other. Since the tweet expresses amazement about Messi's abilities, it fits under surprise because it's like being amazed or astonished.
