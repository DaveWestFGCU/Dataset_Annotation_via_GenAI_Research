Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet is: "God of Messi... Sorry I mean Mercy! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ #BARLIV #ChampionsLeague". 

First, let's break down the content. The user starts with "God of Messi", which seems like a joke or play on words because Messi is a famous footballer. Then they correct themselves by saying "Sorry I mean Mercy!" So it looks like they're messing up their words on purpose, maybe for comedic effect.

The emojis used are ðŸ˜ƒ, which are grinning faces with big smiles. These indicate happiness or joy. The hashtags at the end are #BARLIV and #ChampionsLeague. BARLIV might be a typo or abbreviation related to Barcelona and Real Madrid, two major football clubs. The Champions League is a prestigious competition, so this tweet is likely about that.

Putting it all together, the user seems to be making a funny mistake in their words, using happy emojis, and talking about a significant football event. There's no indication of negative emotions like anger or sadness. Instead, the tone feels light-hearted and cheerful.

So considering the guidelines, if the emotion is similar to serenity or ecstasy, it's joy. The user isn't expressing any other emotion; they're clearly happy with their playful message.
