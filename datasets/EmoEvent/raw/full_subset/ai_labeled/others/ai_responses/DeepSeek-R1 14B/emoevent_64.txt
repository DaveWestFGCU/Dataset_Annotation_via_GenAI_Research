Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The user is talking about DZ-16830 being stuck on Tatooine and only able to read and dream about what's among the stars. They're asking others what books they're reading and using some Star Wars-related hashtags.

First, I'll break down the content. The mention of being stuck suggests maybe some frustration or longing, but it's not explicitly negative. The overall tone seems more reflective and imaginative rather than expressing a strong emotion like anger or sadness. The use of emojis like stars might indicate excitement or wonder about books and space themes.

Looking at the guidelines, if the emotion is similar to serenity or ecstasy, it's joy. If it's pensiveness or grief, it's sadness. Here, the tweet doesn't show any negative emotions; instead, it's more about sharing a moment of reading and imagination. The hashtags also point towards a community or interest in Star Wars, which adds a positive vibe.

So, considering all this, the emotion seems to be joy because they're engaging with books and expressing imaginative thoughts in a positive light.
