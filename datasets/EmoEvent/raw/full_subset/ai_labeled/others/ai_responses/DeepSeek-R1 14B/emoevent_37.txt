Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet is talking about reducing the risk of gun violence and mentions that someone is ignoring Venezuela and #nhpolitics. Hmm, let me break it down.

First, the user starts with a quote: "reduce the risk of gun violence." That sounds like they're agreeing or acknowledging something about disarmament. Then they say, "So it IS all about disarming citizens." The word "IS" is capitalized, which might indicate emphasis or surprise. They seem to be pointing out that the focus is on disarming people.

Next, they mention someone ignoring #Venezuela and #nhpolitics. Venezuela has been in a political crisis, so maybe the user is linking this issue to broader politics. The tone here seems critical because they're implying that important matters are being overlooked or mishandled.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger involves annoyance or rage; disgust is about dislike or disinterest; fear is apprehension or anxiety; joy is serenity or ecstasy; sadness is pensiveness or grief; surprise is distraction or amazement. The tweet doesn't express any positive emotions like joy, so that's out.

The user seems frustrated with the situation, possibly because they feel policies are being misapplied or ignored in a critical context. This frustration could be classified as anger. They're pointing out what they see as an issue without expressing clear disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise. The emphasis on "IS" might suggest some level of exasperation, which aligns with anger.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion here is likely anger because the user is expressing frustration and criticism towards a political decision.
