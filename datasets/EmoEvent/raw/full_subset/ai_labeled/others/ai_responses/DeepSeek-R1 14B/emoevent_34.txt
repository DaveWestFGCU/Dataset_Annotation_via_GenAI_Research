Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The tweet says: "Hey #writingcommunity! Apparently itâ€™s #WorldBookDay! If anyone is looking for a Regency Romance to read, I have one... or two ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜˜ Rose by Another Name [link] #IndieApril #IndieBooks #IndieAuthor"

First, the author is addressing their writing community and mentioning World Book Day. They're promoting their book, "Rose by Another Name," which is a Regency Romance. The tone here seems positive because they're sharing something they've created and are presumably proud of.

Looking at the emojis used: ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜˜ These are all smiley faces, with the first one being a wink and the others showing happiness and affection. This suggests that the author is feeling happy or joyful about sharing their work on World Book Day.

The mention of having "one... or two" books might indicate they're excited to share more than one, which adds to the positive vibe. They're also using hashtags related to indie authors and books, which could be a way to connect with others in the community but doesn't necessarily convey emotion on its own.

Considering the context provided about World Book Day being an event promoting reading and books, it's likely that the author is celebrating this day by sharing their work. This celebration would tie into joy or happiness.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise in the tweet. The focus is on sharing a positive message about their writing and promoting their book. Therefore, the primary emotion here seems to be joy.
