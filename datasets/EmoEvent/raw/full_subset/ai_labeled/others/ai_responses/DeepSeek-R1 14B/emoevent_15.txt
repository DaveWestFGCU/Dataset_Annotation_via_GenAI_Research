Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the tweet mentions "stories that will follow you for life" like Wide Sargasso Sea and The Great Gatsby. These are both known for their intense emotional themesâ€”Wide Sargasso Sea deals with colonialism and identity, while The Great Gatsby is about love and tragedy. So, the author is referencing books that evoke strong emotions.

The tweet then says these stories "play words together in pure pleasure, spinning a tragedy." This part seems to highlight the enjoyment (pleasure) from reading but also acknowledges the tragic elements of the stories. 

Next, the user writes, "Sad and disturbing is my #Trend." Here, they explicitly mention 'sad' and 'disturbing,' which are emotions related to unhappiness or discomfort. The use of "#Trend" suggests that these feelings are something they're currently experiencing or observing.

The tweet also includes the hashtag #WorldBookDay, which ties it back to celebrating books and reading. However, the focus here is more on the emotional impact of the books rather than just promoting reading itself.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, other. The key words are 'sad' and 'disturbing.' Sadness fits because they're describing a feeling related to unhappiness or sorrow. Disgust might come into play if there were elements of dislike or aversion, but the primary emotion here seems to be sadness.

I don't see any signs of anger (annoyance/rage), disgust (dislike/loathing), fear (apprehension/terror), joy (serenity/ecstasy), surprise (distraction/amazement), so it's most likely sadness. The tweet is expressing a trend where the stories are making them feel sad and disturbed, which aligns with the 'sadness' category.
