Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a tweet about Game of Thrones expressing fear that the last season might rush through important details, leaving many questions unanswered. The task is to classify the primary emotion conveyed in the tweet using one of the specified labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or other.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully: "I’m afraid that they’re trying to pack everything into this last season and we are going to miss some keyyyyyy details and there will be lots of unanswered questions." The user is expressing a sense of worry or apprehension about the handling of the final season. They're concerned that crucial elements might be overlooked, leading to unresolved plot points.

Next, I'll consider each emotion category:

1. **Anger**: This would involve expressions of irritation or rage. The tweet doesn't show frustration or anger but rather a fear of missing details.
2. **Disgust**: This relates to feelings of dislike or aversion. There's no indication of disgust in the tweet; it's more about worry.
3. **Fear**: This is about feeling afraid or anxious. The user explicitly states "I’m afraid," which directly points to fear.
4. **Joy**: This would involve happiness or excitement, which isn't present here.
5. **Sadness**: While fear can sometimes overlap with sadness, the primary emotion here seems to be anxiety rather than sorrow.
6. **Surprise**: This involves being unexpectedly amazed. The tweet doesn't express surprise but rather a预感 of potential issues.

Given that the user uses the word "afraid" and expresses concerns about missing details and having unanswered questions, the emotion conveyed is fear. There's no indication of other emotions like anger or sadness; it's clearly focused on anxiety about the series' conclusion.
