Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion it conveys. The tweet says, "Fucking hell that was mint man #GameOf Thrones." 

First, I notice the use of strong language like "fucking hell," which often indicates frustration or anger. The word "mint" here is slang for something being really good or impressive, so the person is expressing excitement about the show.

Putting it together, the user is clearly enthusiastic and happy about Game of Thrones. Even though they used a swear word, the overall tone is positive because they're praising the show. So, the primary emotion here is joy.
