Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says, "I like the books which are more critical #WorldBookDay." Let's break it down.

First, the context is World Book Day, which is about promoting reading and books. The user mentions they like books that are "more critical." Critical can have a couple of meanings here—maybe they mean books that analyze or critique topics in depth, rather than just being positive or surface-level. Alternatively, it could imply that the books are critical in a negative sense, but given the context of World Book Day, which is about celebrating books, I think the user means they appreciate books that offer deeper analysis or are thought-provoking.

So, what emotion does this convey? The user is expressing a preference for a certain type of book. They're not explicitly stating an emotion like happiness or anger; instead, it's more about their intellectual taste. There's no indication of strong positive or negative feelings—just a statement of preference.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: If there's no emotion expressed, or if multiple emotions are present without a dominant one, we classify it as "other." In this case, the tweet is informative and expresses a liking for critical books but doesn't convey any primary emotion like anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. It's more about their personal preference than an emotional state.

Therefore, the appropriate classification here would be "other."

The tweet expresses a preference without conveying a primary emotion.
