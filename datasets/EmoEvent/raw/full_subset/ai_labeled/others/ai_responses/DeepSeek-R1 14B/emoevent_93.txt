Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet is asking who will win the game and reach the final of the Champions League, specifically mentioning Barcelona and Liverpool. 

First, let's break down the content. The user is expressing curiosity about the outcome of a football match between two well-known teams. They're using hashtags related to the competition and the teams involved. 

Now, considering the emotion mapping guidelines: anger would be if they were upset or annoyed, disgust if they disliked something, fear for anxiety or terror, joy for positive feelings like serenity, sadness for pensiveness or grief, surprise for distraction or amazement, and other if none fit.

The tweet doesn't show any negative emotions like anger or disgust. It's not expressing fear or sadness either. There's no clear indication of joy or surprise. Instead, the user is asking a question about who will win, which indicates curiosity or excitement but not necessarily one of the specified emotions. 

Since the emotion isn't clearly fitting into any of the primary categories like anger, disgust, etc., and it's more about anticipation without a dominant emotion, the best classification would be 'other'.

The tweet expresses curiosity about the match outcome without showing a clear primary emotion.

**Answer: other**
