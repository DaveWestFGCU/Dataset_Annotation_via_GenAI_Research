Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet says: "USER They believe that the money will help them to survive any kind of #climatechange #ClimateChangeIsReal and they are wrong#EnvironmentalJustice #GretaThunberg #ClimateActionNow #globalwarming #EnvironmentalJustice #ExtinctionRebellion"

Hmm, breaking this down. The user is talking about people believing money will help them survive climate change, but the user says they're wrong. So the main point here is that relying on money isn't effective against climate change.

I'm trying to identify the emotion here. The user is correcting others' belief, pointing out a flaw in their reasoning. This could be frustration or maybe concern about the misunderstanding of how to address climate change.

Looking at the guidelines: If it's similar to annoyance or rage, it's anger. Disinterest or dislike would be disgust. Apprehension is fear, serenity joy, pensiveness sadness, distraction surprise, else other.

The user isn't expressing personal feelings but pointing out a mistake. It's more of a statement than an emotional expression. So maybe there's no dominant emotion hereâ€”it's informative rather than emotional.

Alternatively, the user could be frustrated with others' views, which might lean towards anger. But since it's a correction without strong emotional language, I'm not sure.

Wait, the tweet is part of a movement by Greta Thunberg about climate strikes. The context is activism, so maybe the emotion here is more about concern or urgency, but those aren't in the primary list. So perhaps 'other' since it's informative rather than expressing a clear emotion.

The tweet primarily serves to inform and correct others' beliefs without explicitly conveying a dominant emotion. Therefore, it falls under "other."

**Answer: other**
