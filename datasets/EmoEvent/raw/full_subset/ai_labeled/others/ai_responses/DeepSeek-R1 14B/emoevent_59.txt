Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet is asking if President Trump (referred to as #45) has posted a fake video blaming a specific religious group for celebrating the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. 

First, let's understand the context. The Notre Dame Cathedral fire was a significant event that caused widespread sadness and concern. It was a tragic loss of cultural heritage. Now, the tweet is questioning whether Trump has made any false accusations regarding this incident.

The emotion here seems to be about potential misinformation or spreading lies. The user is concerned or upset about the possibility of such a fake video being posted. This could relate to anger because they might be frustrated or annoyed at the idea of someone falsely accusing others, especially in such a sensitive context.

Alternatively, it could also touch on fear if the user is worried about the implications of such a video spreading misinformation. However, the primary emotion seems more directed towards frustration or irritation at the potential action by Trump, which would lean towards anger.
