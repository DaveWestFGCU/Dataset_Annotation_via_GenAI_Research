Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The tweet says, "#NotreDameCathedralFire Glory, then ashes Men's dreams in a spark transformed Burning hearts unite 🌹🙏". 

First, let me break down the words and phrases used. "Glory" suggests something positive or majestic, but it's followed by "then ashes," which indicates destruction or loss. The phrase "Men's dreams in a spark transformed" seems to imply that something once great (the men's dreams) was suddenly changed, perhaps destroyed. "Burning hearts unite" could mean people coming together because of their shared pain or experience.

The emojis used are 🌹 and 🙏. The rose emoji often symbolizes love, beauty, or sympathy, while the prayer hands emoji suggests a request for help or gratitude. 

Putting this all together, the tweet seems to express a sense of loss and devastation due to the fire but also a call to unity among people affected by it. The author is likely feeling sad about the destruction but also showing solidarity with others.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger would involve frustration or rage, which doesn't seem to fit here. Disgust is more about dislike, which isn't present. Fear involves anxiety or terror; while the fire was a disaster, the tweet doesn't focus on fear. Joy and surprise are also not applicable as the overall tone is somber. The primary emotion seems to be sadness because of the loss and the impact on people's lives.
