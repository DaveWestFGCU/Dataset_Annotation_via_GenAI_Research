Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is asking if we know for sure how the fire started and mentions they haven't seen any details yet. 

First, let's break down the tweet. The user is expressing uncertainty or a desire for information. They're not showing strong emotions like anger or sadness but are seeking clarity. So, what emotion does that fall under?

Looking at the guidelines: If the tweet conveys no emotion, multiple emotions without a dominant one, or more context is needed, classify it as 'other'. In this case, the user isn't expressing any of the primary emotions listed like anger, disgust, fear, etc. They're just asking for information.

So, since there's no clear emotion being conveyed and it's more about seeking details rather than expressing a feeling, the appropriate classification would be 'other'.

The tweet is inquiring about the cause of the fire without expressing any specific emotion. Therefore, it falls under 'other'.

**Answer:** other
