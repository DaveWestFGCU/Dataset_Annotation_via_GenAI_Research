Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet says: "Roses and books. Happy #WorldBookDay and #SantJordi. ðŸŒ¹ðŸ“š . . . . . . #indiegame #indiedev #gamedev #indiegamedev #indiegame #DiaInternacionalDelLibro #DiaDelLibro #SantJordi2019 #BookDay https://t.co/9HBVfp9nJd"

First, I notice the user is using a lot of hashtags related to books and specific days like World Book Day and Sant Jordi. They also included emojis: a rose and a book. The text starts with "Roses and books" which sounds positive. Then they say "Happy #WorldBookDay", so that's definitely expressing happiness.

Looking at the structure, it's all about celebrating books and related events. There are no negative words or any signs of anger, fear, or sadness. The emojis used are roses (which symbolize love or beauty) and books, which are associated with knowledge and joy.

The hashtags also support this positive sentiment. They're promoting indie games and development, but that's more about sharing interests rather than expressing emotion. However, the main message is about celebrating World Book Day, which is a happy occasion.

I don't see any elements of surprise or fear here. It's all about happiness and celebration. So the primary emotion conveyed is joy.
