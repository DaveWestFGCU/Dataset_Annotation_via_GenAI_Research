Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet by Greta Thunberg. Let me read it again: "Looks like German cities will start calling it #ClimateEmergency after the city of #Konstanz has declared the state of climate emergency. Other cities will follow - I'm pretty sure. Thanks to #GretaThunberg https://t.co/JMWZ3S3Mth"

Hmm, Greta is known for her activism on climate change. The tweet mentions that German cities are starting to declare a climate emergency, following Konstanz's lead. She seems confident that others will follow and she gives thanks to herself, which is typical of her style.

The emotion here... Well, she's talking about progress in the movement. Cities taking action because of her influence. That sounds positive. She might be feeling hopeful or satisfied with the impact of her work. There's no negative language; instead, it's more about affirmation and success.

Looking at the guidelines: joy is associated with serenity or ecstasy, but also any positive emotions related to success. Since she's celebrating progress in the movement, that fits under joy.
