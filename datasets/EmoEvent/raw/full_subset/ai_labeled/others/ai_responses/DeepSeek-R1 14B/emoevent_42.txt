Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user mentions that they find the show intriguing because of its politics and drama, not just the action. Then they say they think a particular character's death or resolution could have been handled more thrillingly.

Hmm, let me break this down. The first part is positive; they enjoy the political aspects. But then there's a critique about how a character was dealt with. So, it's not purely negative or positive. They're expressing an opinion that something could have been better. That sounds like disappointment or dissatisfaction.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger is more about rage or annoyance, disgust is for dislike or loathing, fear is anxiety or terror, joy is happiness, sadness is pensiveness or grief, surprise is amazement or distraction, and other if none fit.

The user isn't expressing outright anger or disgust. They're pointing out a flaw in the show's execution but not with intense emotion. It's more of a critique than a strong negative feeling. So maybe it's closer to sadness because they might feel let down or disappointed, which can tie into sadness. Alternatively, it could be 'other' if none of the primary emotions fit.

Wait, disappointment isn't directly listed in the options. The closest would be sadness because it involves a sense of loss or unmet expectations. So I think sadness is the best fit here.
