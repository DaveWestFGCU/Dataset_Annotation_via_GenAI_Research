Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet says: "I'm tired of people that take their views from tabloid media. Attacking #gretathunberg because her mUm pRObAbLy uSEd a PlAnE according to Rupert Murdoch, therefore USER protests are redundant. Stop being a slowly boiled frog sheep."

Alright, breaking this down. The author is expressing frustration with people who base their opinions on tabloid media. They're attacking Greta Thunberg because of claims about her mother using a plane, which they attribute to Rupert Murdoch's influence. The author dismisses these attacks and calls others "slowly boiled frog sheep," implying they're being manipulated or not thinking clearly.

The word "tired" suggests frustration or exasperation. The tone is critical and annoyed towards those who are attacking Greta based on what the author perceives as false information from tabloids. Using words like "attacking," "redundant," and "sheep" adds to that negative sentiment.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or other. The primary emotion here seems to be frustration or exasperation, which falls under anger because it's a form of annoyance or irritation.
