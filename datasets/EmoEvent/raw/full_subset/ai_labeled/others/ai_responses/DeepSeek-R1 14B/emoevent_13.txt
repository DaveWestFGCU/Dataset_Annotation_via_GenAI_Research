Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Venezuela's political situation. The user starts by imagining a scenario where someone else tries their plan and it fails, which saves them from making the same mistake. Then they say "eff it" and decide to vote for USER and socialism anyway. They also include hashtags like #Socialism is stupid and #SocialismKills.

First, I'll break down the content. The tweet seems to express frustration or disappointment with socialism, given the hashtags. The author mentions seeing their plan fail, which could lead to feelings of anger or disgust. But they then decide to support socialism despite this, which might indicate some level of commitment but also a sense of defiance.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: anger is for annoyance or rage, disgust for disinterest or dislike. The hashtags clearly show contempt towards socialism, suggesting disgust rather than anger. There's no indication of fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or other emotions here. The primary feeling seems to be a strong dislike or aversion towards socialism, which fits under disgust.
