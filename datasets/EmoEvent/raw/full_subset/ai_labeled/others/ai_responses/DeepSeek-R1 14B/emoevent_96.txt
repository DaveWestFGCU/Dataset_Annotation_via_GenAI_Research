Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Greta Thunberg. Let me read it again: "USER 16 year old Swede #GretaThunberg, has more brains, heart &amp; courage. Then 90% of America's #Congress Combined! - https://t.co/nSYugvsVJl"

Hmm, the tweet is praising Greta Thunberg. It says she has more brains, heart, and courage than 90% of America's Congress combined. That sounds like a compliment. The user is highlighting her positive qualities and comparing her favorably to members of Congress, which might be implying that Congress isn't as effective or lacks these qualities.

So the emotion here seems to be admiration or respect. But looking at the options given: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, other. None of those directly match admiration. Let's see:

- Anger: Not present; the tweet is positive.
- Disgust: No, it's not expressing dislike.
- Fear: Doesn't seem to be about fear.
- Joy: Maybe, but it's more about respect than pure joy.
- Sadness: No sadness here.
- Surprise: The comparison could be surprising, but I don't think that's the main emotion.
- Other: If none of the above fit.

Wait, maybe "joy" is the closest because expressing admiration can bring joy. Alternatively, if it's just a factual statement without strong emotion, it might fall under "other." But since the user is clearly impressed and praising her, I think there's an underlying positive emotion.

I'm leaning towards "joy" because the tweet conveys a sense of approval and positivity, which aligns with joy. Alternatively, if it's more about respect than emotion, maybe "other," but I think joy fits better.
