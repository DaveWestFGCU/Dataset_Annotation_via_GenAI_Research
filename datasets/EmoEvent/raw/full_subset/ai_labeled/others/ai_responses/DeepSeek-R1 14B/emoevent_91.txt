Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The user is talking about Greta Thunberg being a great example of why neurodiversity matters and mentions hashtags related to autism and neurodiversity. 

First, let's break down the content. They're praising Greta as an example for neurodiversity, which suggests they have a positive view. The use of words like "great" and the inclusion of supportive hashtags indicates approval or admiration.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger is about annoyance or rage, which doesn't fit here. Disgust relates to dislike, but again, this isn't the case. Fear would involve anxiety or terror, which isn't present. Joy is about serenity or ecstasyâ€”maybe positive feelings, so that's a possibility.

Sadness involves pensiveness or grief, which isn't evident. Surprise is for distraction or amazement; while Greta is notable, the tweet doesn't express surprise. The emotion here seems to be admiration and approval, which falls under joy because it's a positive sentiment without any negative undertones.

So, I think the primary emotion is joy.
