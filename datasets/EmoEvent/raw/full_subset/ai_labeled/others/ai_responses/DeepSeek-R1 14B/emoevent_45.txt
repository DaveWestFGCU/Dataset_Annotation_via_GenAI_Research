Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says, "Congratulations to us on winning #LaLiga ... Again 游때游때#FcBarcelona #Bar칞a 8 in 11 years." 

First, let's break down the content. The user is celebrating a win in La Liga, which is a significant achievement in Spanish football. They mention that it's another victory, highlighting their success over time with eight wins in eleven years. The use of emojis 游때游때 shows they're happy and excited about this accomplishment.

The emotion here seems to be joy because they're expressing happiness and pride about winning the league again. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or sadness. They're clearly thrilled, which aligns with the 'joy' category in the guidelines. The emojis are a strong indicator too, as they convey a sense of excitement and happiness.

I don't see any elements pointing towards other emotions like surprise or fear. It's more about celebrating an achievement rather than being surprised by it or feeling anxious. So, the primary emotion is joy.
