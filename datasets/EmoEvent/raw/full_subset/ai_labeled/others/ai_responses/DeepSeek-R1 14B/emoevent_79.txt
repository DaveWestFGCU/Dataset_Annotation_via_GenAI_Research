Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet is about Extinction Rebellion protesters standing in European elections and includes several hashtags related to Greta Thunberg, climate change, and European elections.

First, let me break down the content. The mention of Extinction Rebellion suggests a group that's involved in activism, likely focused on environmental issues. They're participating in elections, which could indicate an organized effort to influence policy or raise awareness. The hashtags like #ClimateChangeTheFacts and #climate show their focus is on climate change.

Now, considering the emotion guidelines: anger is for annoyance or rage, disgust for dislike, fear for apprehension, joy for serenity, sadness for pensiveness, surprise for distraction or amazement, and other if none fit.

This tweet seems more about an announcement or call to action rather than expressing a specific emotion. It's informative but doesn't convey any strong emotion like anger or joy. There's no indication of fear or surprise; it's just stating facts. The use of multiple hashtags is typical for spreading information, not necessarily expressing feelings.

So, since the tweet isn't primarily conveying one of the specified emotions and is more about an event or announcement, the appropriate classification would be 'other'.
