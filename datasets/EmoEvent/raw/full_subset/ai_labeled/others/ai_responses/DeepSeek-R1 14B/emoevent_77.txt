Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says, "Holy fucking shit. What an episode that was. Arya, you hard little cunt #got #GameOfThrones #GOTS8E3." 

First, let's break down the language used. The user starts with "Holy fucking shit," which is a strong exclamation indicating surprise or shock. Then they mention it being "what an episode," suggesting it was unexpected or intense. The use of profanity like "hard little cunt" directed at Arya could be expressing frustration or anger, but given the context of the show and the way fans often react to shocking moments, it might also be a sign of surprise.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: Surprise is when there's a sense of distraction or amazement. The tweet seems to capture that moment where something unexpected happened, leading to strong reactions. While there's some frustration in the language towards Arya, the primary reaction here is likely the astonishment from the episode's content.

So considering all this, I think the emotion here is surprise.
