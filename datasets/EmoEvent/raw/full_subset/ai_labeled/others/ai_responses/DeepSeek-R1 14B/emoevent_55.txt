Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet: "Mayday Mayday USER have been hit. Send help #ChampionsLeague". Let me break it down step by step.

First, the tweet starts with "Mayday Mayday", which is a distress signal, often used when someone is in serious trouble or danger. That immediately makes me think of fear or urgency. The user then says they've been hit and are asking for help. The word "hit" could imply physical harm or being targeted, which adds to the sense of emergency.

Looking at the context provided, it's about the UEFA Champions League, a football competition. But the tweet itself doesn't mention anything related to the game directly; instead, it's a call for help using the #ChampionsLeague hashtag. So maybe the user is part of a team or following the league and feels distressed.

The emotions associated with "Mayday" are typically fear or anxiety. The person is in a situation where they need immediate assistance, which suggests fear. There's no indication of anger, disgust, joy, sadness, or surprise here. It's more about an urgent plea for help, which falls under fear because it's a cry for rescue due to being in trouble.

I don't think it's "other" because there is a clear emotion expressedâ€”fear. The use of "Mayday" specifically points towards that. So the primary emotion here should be fear.
