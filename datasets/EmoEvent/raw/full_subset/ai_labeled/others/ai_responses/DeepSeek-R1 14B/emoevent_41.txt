Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says, "Sam struggling to keep his fat boy ass alive Jon snow : #GameOfThrones". Hmm, let me break it down.

First, the mention of Sam and Jon Snow is straightforward—they're characters from the show. But the way the author refers to Sam as "his fat boy ass" seems a bit harsh. The word "fat" could be seen as derogatory or critical towards Sam's appearance. Also, the phrase "struggling to keep his... alive" might imply that the author thinks Sam isn't doing a good job in keeping Jon alive, which could indicate frustration.

So, putting it together, the tweet seems to express dissatisfaction or annoyance with Sam's actions or abilities. The use of slang and criticism points towards a negative emotion. Now, looking at the mapping guidelines: if the emotion is similar to annoyance or rage, classify as anger. Here, the author is clearly expressing frustration or irritation towards Sam, which fits under anger.

I don't think it's disgust because there's no indication of dislike for something else; it's more about the action of Sam. Fear isn't present here either—no signs of anxiety or terror. Sadness and surprise also don't seem to apply. The emotion is definitely a form of irritation, so anger is the right classification.
