Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet is about World Book Day and asks others what their favorite book is. It uses emojis like a book and Earth, which are positive symbols related to reading and the world. The tone seems friendly and inviting, encouraging interaction. There's no negative language or signs of any other emotions like anger or fear. The main feeling here is joy because it's celebrating books and promoting a love for reading.
