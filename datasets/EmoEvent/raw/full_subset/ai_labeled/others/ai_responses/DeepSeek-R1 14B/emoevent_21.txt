Record: "People kinda upset about more characters not dying, keep in mind there is STILL one more war left and the Dothraki are pretty much gone so is half of the Unsullied. More characters will die gents. I guarantee that. #GameofThrones"

Okay, let's try to figure out what emotion this tweet is conveying. The user is talking about people being upset because more characters aren't dying yet. They mention that there's still another war coming and that some major groups like the Dothraki and half of the Unsullied are already gone. So they're hinting that more deaths are inevitable.

The primary emotion here seems to be a sense of impending doom or dread. The author is pointing out that despite people's current feelings, there's still more conflict ahead, which will lead to further losses. This makes me think of fear because the tweet is highlighting things that might cause anxiety or apprehension about what's coming next.

I don't see any signs of joy or surprise here; it's more about anticipating negative events. Sadness could be a component, but the main emotion seems to be fear due to the emphasis on upcoming dangers and losses.
