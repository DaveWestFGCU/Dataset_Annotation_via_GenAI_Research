Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The user says books are like their best parents, teachers, etc., and that they never say no. Hmm, that sounds really positive. Words like "best" and "never say NO" indicate appreciation and love for books. So the emotion here is likely joy because they're expressing how wonderful books are to them. No negative feelings or fears, just pure happiness.
