Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet is asking, "Which book you love the most to read???" with the hashtag #WorldBookDay. 

First, let's break down the context given. World Book Day is an event by UNESCO promoting reading and books. So it's a positive occasion about literature.

Looking at the tweet itself, the user is asking others about their favorite books. The use of multiple question marks suggests excitement or enthusiasm. They're engaging with others to share their love for books.

Now, considering the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, other. The tweet doesn't show any negative emotions like anger or disgust. It's not expressing fear or sadness either. Surprise isn't really applicable here because there's no unexpected information.

The key emotion here seems to be joy. The user is excited about books and wants others to share their favorites, which indicates a positive and happy sentiment. They're likely feeling enthusiastic and spreading that joy through their question.

I don't think it's 'other' because the emotion is clearâ€”joy. There's no ambiguity or multiple emotions without a dominant one. So, the primary emotion is joy.

The tweet expresses enthusiasm and excitement about books, which falls under joy.
