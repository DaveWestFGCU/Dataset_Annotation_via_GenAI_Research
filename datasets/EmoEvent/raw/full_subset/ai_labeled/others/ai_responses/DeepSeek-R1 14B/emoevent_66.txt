Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Game of Thrones. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet says: "Watching #GOTS8E3 last night, both parents call, text, and leave voicemails for SO and me. Us: Everything ok? Did someone die?! Them: WE DON'T KNOW YET BECAUSE WE FORGOT YOUR USER LOGIN!! #AryaStark #NightKing #GameofThrones"

Hmm, the user is talking about watching episode 3 of season 8 of Game of Thrones. Their parents called, texted, and left voicemails for both them and their significant other (SO). The parents seem worried because they're asking if everything's okay or if someone died. But then the twist comes: the parents forgot their user login, so they don't know what happened.

The tweet ends with a humorous take on the situation, using hashtags related to characters like Arya Stark and the Night King. So, the user is probably making a joke about how intense the episode was that even their parents got worried but couldn't check because of a login issue.

Looking at the emotions: The user's reaction seems to be a mix of surprise and maybe some amusement. They're highlighting the absurdity of the situation where such a serious question (did someone die?) is followed by something trivial like forgetting a login. It's unexpected and probably made them laugh or feel surprised.

But according to the guidelines, I need to classify it into one of the primary emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or other. The tweet doesn't show any strong negative emotion like anger or disgust. There's no fear expressed; instead, the parents' reaction is more about confusion and worry, but that's not the user's emotion.

The user seems to be pointing out a funny situation, which would relate to joy (serenity/ecstasy) or surprise (distraction/amazement). Since it's a humorous twist after a tense moment, I think surprise fits better because it's unexpected and creates a sense of amazement. Alternatively, joy could also make sense if the user is amused.

But considering the context, the parents' reaction leading to confusion might be more surprising than joyful for the user. So, I'm leaning towards surprise as the primary emotion here.
