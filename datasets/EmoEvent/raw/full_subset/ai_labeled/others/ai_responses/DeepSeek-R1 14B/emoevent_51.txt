Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet says: "And to think having the undead now would be bad Pfff imagine living in an Era where your weapons were only swords and shields etc. Literally felt i was watching Infinity War again but #GameofThrones style"

Hmm, breaking this down. The user starts by talking about the undead being a problem, then expresses a comparison to Infinity War but with Game of Thrones style. They use "Pfff," which sounds like a dismissive or sarcastic noise.

I think they're making fun of how even something as scary as undead in Infinity War isn't as bad as the situation in Game of Thrones. Maybe they're highlighting that GoT's setting is so medieval and less advanced, making their battles seem more difficult or outdated compared to sci-fi like Infinity War.

The tone here seems a bit sarcastic and maybe a touch annoyed or frustrated. They're pointing out the contrast between the two shows, perhaps in a way that mocks how behind-the-times Game of Thrones' weapons are. So, is this anger? Or maybe surprise?

Wait, the guidelines say if it's similar to annoyance or rage, classify as anger. Sarcastic comments can sometimes be a sign of mild anger or frustration. Alternatively, could it be surprise because they're comparing two different universes and feeling that way about it?

But I think the primary emotion here is more frustration or sarcasm, which falls under anger. They're not expressing extreme anger but a form of irritation at the situation described.

So, I'll go with anger.
