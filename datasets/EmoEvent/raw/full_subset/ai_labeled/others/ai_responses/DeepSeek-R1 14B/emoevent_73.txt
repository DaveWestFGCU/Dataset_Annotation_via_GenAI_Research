Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet starts with some hashtags like USER_Belief and mentions @_Cuppa_Tea. Then there's a lot of "USER" repeated, which might be placeholders or something else. It says thanks to @_Cuppa_Tea for including the user in their #MatchDay #ShoutOut. The user appreciates it and hopes everyone has a great Wednesday and enjoys the #Match tonight. They also include some football-related hashtags like #YNWA, #LFC, #UCL, #ChampionsLeague, and #BARLIV.

Looking at the content, the tweet is about being included in a shoutout for MatchDay, expressing gratitude, and wishing others well. The tone seems positive and supportive. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or disgust. Instead, it's more about appreciation and hope for a good time during the match.

So, considering the guidelines, if the tweet conveys serenity or ecstasy, it would be joy. Here, the user is expressing happiness and positivity, which aligns with joy.
