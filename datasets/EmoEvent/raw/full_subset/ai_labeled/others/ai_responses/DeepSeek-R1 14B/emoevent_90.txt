Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The tweet says, "Works of arts confirmed safe #NotreDameCathedralFire" with a link. 

First, let's break down the content. The user is confirming that works of art are safe during the fire at Notre-Dame. This seems positive because they're stating that important cultural items were preserved. So, the emotion here might be relief or happiness.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: joy includes emotions like serenity or ecstasy. Relief can sometimes fall under joy because it's a positive feeling after a stressful event. The tweet doesn't express any negative emotions; instead, it's sharing good news amidst a tragedy.

I should consider if there are other possible emotions. Could it be surprise? Maybe, but the focus is on safety rather than something unexpected. It's more about affirmation of safety, which leans towards joy or relief.

So, the primary emotion here is likely joy because they're expressing that things turned out well despite the fire.
