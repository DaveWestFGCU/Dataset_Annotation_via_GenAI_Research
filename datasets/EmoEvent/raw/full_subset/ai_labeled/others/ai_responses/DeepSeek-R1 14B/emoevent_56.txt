Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet says: "The outrage of the students striking from school over #climatechange inaction is 'certainly justified', according to #SirDavidAttenborough, who said older generations had done terrible damage to the planet." There's a heart emoji and some hashtags like #FridaysforFuture and #GretaThunberg.

First, I notice that the tweet mentions "outrage" of students. Outrage is a strong emotion, often linked with anger. The students are striking because they're upset about climate change inaction. Sir David Attenborough supports them, saying their outrage is justified. So the main feeling here seems to be anger or frustration towards the lack of action on climate change.

The heart emoji might indicate support or love for the cause, but the primary emotion isn't about affection. It's more about the students' strong reaction to the situation. There's no indication of fear, joy, sadness, surprise, disgust, or other emotions dominating here. The focus is on the justified outrage, which falls under anger.

So I think the emotion here is anger.
