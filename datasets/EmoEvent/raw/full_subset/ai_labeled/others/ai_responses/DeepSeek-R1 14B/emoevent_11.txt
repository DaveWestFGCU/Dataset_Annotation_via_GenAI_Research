Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion of this tweet about World Book Day. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet starts with a quote from Rabindranath Tagore: "The highest education is that which does not merely give us information but makes our life in harmony with all existence." Then it says, "As we celebrate #WorldBookDay, let us reflect on these wise words by Rabindranath Tagore. #ElevationNG" followed by a link.

Hmm, the quote itself seems philosophical and positive. It's talking about education that goes beyond just facts to create harmony in life. The tweet is sharing this wisdom and encouraging reflection. They're celebrating World Book Day, which is all about promoting reading and books. The use of words like "wise" and "reflect" suggests a thoughtful and uplifting tone.

I don't see any negative emotions here. There's no anger, disgust, fear, or sadness expressed. Instead, the language is inspiring and focused on learning and harmony. Maybe it's trying to evoke a sense of joy or inspiration through the quote and the celebration.

Looking at the guidelines, if the emotion is similar to serenity or ecstasy, it's joy. The tweet seems to be promoting a positive reflection and celebrating books, which aligns with joy. There's no secondary emotion like surprise or fear; it's more about spreading positivity.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion here is joy because of the uplifting message and celebration.
