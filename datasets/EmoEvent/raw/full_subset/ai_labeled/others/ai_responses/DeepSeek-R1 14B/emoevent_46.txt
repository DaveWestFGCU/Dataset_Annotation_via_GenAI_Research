Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet says: "Football: #Ajax beat #Tottenham in Champions League match Dutch team beat English side 1-0 in first-leg match #ChampionsLeague https://t.co/4QetMzPQFH https://t.co/rAEz4RGcwm"

Alright, breaking this down. The tweet is about a football (soccer) match where Ajax, a Dutch team, defeated Tottenham, an English team, with a score of 1-0 in the first leg of the Champions League.

First, I should consider the emotion associated with winning a game, especially in a competition like the Champions League. Typically, when a team wins, people might feel happy or excited. But let's analyze more deeply.

The tweet is factual and reports the result without any explicit emotional language. There are no emojis expressing joy or excitement. It just states the outcome: Ajax won 1-0. So, there's no overt expression of emotion here.

Looking at the context provided, the Champions League is a prestigious competition, so winning could be significant for Ajax fans. However, the tweet itself doesn't express any emotions; it's more of an informative statement.

The guidelines mention that if the tweet conveys no emotion or multiple emotions without a dominant one, we should classify it as 'other'. Since this tweet is neutral and just reports the result without indicating how the author feels, there's no clear primary emotion to assign.

Therefore, the appropriate classification here would be 'other' because there's no expressed emotion in the text.
