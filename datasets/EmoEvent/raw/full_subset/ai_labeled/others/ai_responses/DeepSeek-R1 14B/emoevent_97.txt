Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet directed at Greta Thunberg. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet starts with "Dear #GretaThunberg," which is polite but might be a setup for something else. The next part says, "we're not even close to being one of the most 'selfish' pollutant country you dare to come to by using natural resources and presume lecture." Hmm, so they're calling Greta out for coming to their country, implying she's lecturing them when they might feel she doesn't have the right to do so. The word "dare" suggests a challenge or maybe frustration.

Then it continues: "Kindly take your insignificant cares to the countries and their leaders who really are." So they're telling her to leave and go where she's needed more, implying that her concerns aren't significant here. The tone seems dismissive and perhaps annoyed or irritated.

Looking at the context provided, Greta Thunberg is known for her climate strikes, so this tweet is likely a response from someone opposing her message. The use of words like "selfish," "pollutant country," and "insignificant cares" indicates that the author feels Greta's actions are misplaced or not applicable to them.

The emotion here isn't just simple anger; it might be more frustration or irritation, which falls under the category of anger as per the guidelines. There's no clear sign of other emotions like fear or joy. The language is confrontational but doesn't express any positive feelings or surprise. It's more about dismissing Greta's message and telling her to go elsewhere.

So, considering all this, the primary emotion seems to be anger because it's a direct challenge with a tone of irritation and frustration.
