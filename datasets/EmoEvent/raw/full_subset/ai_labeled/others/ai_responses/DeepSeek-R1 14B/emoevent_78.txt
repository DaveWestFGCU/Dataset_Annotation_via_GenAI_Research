Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Greta Thunberg. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet says: "USER The Manufacturing of #GretaThunberg - Media accompaniment, media attention ordered from the beginning (8/20/2018). - Placement of the advertising medium #Greta in major Newspapers! - at Swedish and international conferences - PR for profitable share issue https://t.co/MED97XwVvF"

Hmm. The user is talking about how Greta Thunberg's media presence was manufactured, mentioning media attention ordered from the start, placement in newspapers, conferences, and PR for a share issue. It seems like they're pointing out that her movement might be manipulated or controlled by media and possibly financial interests.

So, what emotion does this convey? The user is highlighting the behind-the-scenes aspects of Greta's rise, suggesting it's not organic but planned. This could indicate skepticism or doubt about her authenticity or the movement's genuineness.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: If the tweet conveys a secondary emotion similar to disinterest, dislike, or loathing, classify as disgust. The user seems critical and perhaps dislikes how Greta is being portrayed, which aligns with disgust.
