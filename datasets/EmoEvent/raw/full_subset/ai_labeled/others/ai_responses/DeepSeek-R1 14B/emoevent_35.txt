Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. The user is talking about wanting more progressive members of Congress to speak out against an "illegal imperialist coup" and mentions that someone did earlier today, encouraging others to follow suit.

First, let me break down the language used. Words like "illegal," "imperialist coup," and "HandsOffVenezuela" suggest a strong stance against what's happening in Venezuela. The user is advocating for more people to speak out, which indicates they're passionate about this issue.

The emotion here seems to be directed towards frustration or anger. They're not just stating facts but expressing a desire for action, implying that the current situation is unacceptable. The use of terms like "illegal" and "imperialist" can carry negative connotations, indicating dislike or opposition.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: if it's similar to annoyance or rage, classify as anger. Here, the user isn't just stating an opinion but is urging others to take a stand, which shows a strong emotional responseâ€”likely anger towards the situation in Venezuela and possibly towards those they perceive as not doing enough.

I don't see elements of fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or disgust dominating here. The primary emotion seems to be frustration and a call to action against what's seen as an unfair situation, which aligns with anger.
