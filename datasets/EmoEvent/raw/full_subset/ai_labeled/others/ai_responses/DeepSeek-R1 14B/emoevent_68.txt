Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The tweet is: "Here are 3 things you may have missed on #SocialMedia this week! #TigerWoods #Lush #NotreDameCathedralFire https://t.co/wOkZ9At3Ur"

First, I'll break down the components of the tweet. It's a list of three things people might have missed on social media that week. The hashtags included are #TigerWoods, which is about a well-known golfer; #Lush, which could refer to the company or something else; and #NotreDameCathedralFire, referencing the tragic event where the cathedral caught fire.

The user is sharing three topics, each with their own hashtag. The mention of Notre Dame Cathedral Fire is significant because it's a major news event that evokes strong emotions like sadness or concern. However, the way it's presented here is as part of a list of social media highlights. 

I need to assess if the primary emotion conveyed by the tweet is about the fire itself or just listing events neutrally. The tone seems neutral and informative, not expressing any personal emotion towards each topic. It's more about sharing information rather than reacting emotionally.

Since the tweet doesn't express a clear emotion related to the Notre Dame fire but is instead presenting it as one of three news items, I don't think there's a dominant emotion here. The author isn't expressing their feelings about the fire; they're just listing topics. Therefore, according to the guidelines, if there are no emotions expressed or multiple without a dominant one, it should be classified as 'other'.
