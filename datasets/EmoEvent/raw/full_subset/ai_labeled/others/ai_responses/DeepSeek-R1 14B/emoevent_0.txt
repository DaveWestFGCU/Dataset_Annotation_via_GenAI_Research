Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The tweet is: "#French investigators probing the devastating blaze at #NotreDame questioned workers who were renovating the monument on https://t.co/ix2SM8LtOA  #NotreDameCathedralFire"

First, I'll break down the content. It's talking about French investigators looking into a devastating fire that occurred at Notre-Dame. They're questioning renovation workers. The use of words like "devastating blaze" suggests something tragic and destructive.

Now, considering the emotions: anger is usually when someone is upset or annoyed. Disgust might be if there was dislike or厌恶 towards something. Fear would involve anxiety or terror. Joy is happiness, which doesn't seem to fit here. Sadness would relate to grief or pensiveness. Surprise could be from unexpected events.

The tweet is factual and informative, not expressing a strong emotion like anger or sadness directly. It's more about reporting the situation. There's no clear indication of any specific emotion; it's just stating what happened and who is being questioned.

So, since the tweet doesn't convey any dominant emotion but rather presents information neutrally, the appropriate classification would be "other."
