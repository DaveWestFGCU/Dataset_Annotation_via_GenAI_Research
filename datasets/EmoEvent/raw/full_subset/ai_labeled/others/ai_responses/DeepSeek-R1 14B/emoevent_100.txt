Record: "If the climate change response is one which is funded by, defers to and/or furthers the aims of capitalism then it will be counterproductive.  I hope Labour don't end up rushing into bed with the funders behind the #GretaThunberg hype.  Beware the Non-Profit Industrial Complex. https://t.co/sSMv1FVaLt"

Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion Greta Thunberg is conveying. The tweet starts by talking about how a climate change response funded by capitalism would be counterproductive. She expresses hope that Labour doesn't align with certain funders behind #GretaThunberg and warns about the Non-Profit Industrial Complex.

First, I notice she's discussing political and economic implications of climate action. Her tone seems cautious and concerned. The mention of being wary suggests a sense of apprehension or anxiety about potential negative outcomes. She's not overtly expressing anger or sadness but is highlighting a possible threat or danger in the situation.

Looking at the emotion categories, fear relates to emotions like apprehension or anxiety. While she's discussing specific issues, her main concern seems to be about future repercussions, which aligns with fear rather than other emotions like disgust or surprise. There's no indication of joy or sadness here; it's more about anticipating a negative outcome.

So, considering the guidelines, this tweet conveys apprehension, which falls under fear.
