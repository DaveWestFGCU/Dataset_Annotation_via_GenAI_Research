Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Bran during the Battle of Winterfell from Game of Thrones. The tweet is just a short statement with a hashtag and a link. Let me break it down.

First, the content mentions "Bran" and "the battle of winterfell." From what I know, Bran Stark is a character known for his quiet demeanor and being somewhat removed from the main plotlines until later seasons. The Battle of Winterfell was a significant event in the series where Bran plays a crucial role by using his powers as the Three-Eyed Raven to defeat the Night King.

The tweet doesn't express any explicit emotion through words; it's just stating a fact about Bran during that battle. There are no emojis or exclamation marks indicating strong feelings. The link probably leads to some visual content, but without seeing it, I can only assume it might be a fan reaction or a recap.

Since the tweet is factual and doesn't show any clear emotion like anger, joy, or surprise, it's hard to pin down a primary emotion. It could be that the author is sharing information rather than expressing feelings. Alternatively, if the linked content has images or reactions, maybe there's an implied emotion, but based solely on the text provided, there's no indication of that.

Given the guidelines, if the tweet conveys no emotion or multiple emotions without a dominant one, it should be classified as "other." There's no secondary emotion like annoyance or fear here; it's more about stating an event involving Bran.
