Alright, let me try to figure out the emotion behind this tweet. The user is talking about a #BARLIV match and mentions they would have tweeted something funny if they watched it live. They use emojis like 😂 and explain that it's an inside joke with 🙄 and some text. They end with "goodnight family" and hashtags related to the Champions League.

So, the tweet is clearly humorous. The author is sharing a joke about a football match, using emojis to convey laughter. Even though they mention not getting it without context, the overall tone is light-hearted and playful. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or sadness. Instead, the focus is on humor and camaraderie with their "family" group.

Looking at the emotion labels, joy fits because the tweet is meant to make people laugh and share a positive experience. The other options don't apply here since there's no sign of fear, surprise, disgust, etc. It's definitely not 'other' because it clearly conveys an emotion—joy through humor.
