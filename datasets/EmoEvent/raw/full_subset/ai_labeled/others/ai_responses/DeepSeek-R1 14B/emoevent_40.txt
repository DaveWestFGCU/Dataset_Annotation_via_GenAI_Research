Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The tweet says, "In this hustle bustle and busy scenario #book could be the best friends of a lonely person. #WorldBookDay ðŸŒŽðŸ“šðŸ“—ðŸ“˜ðŸ“™ðŸ“”ðŸ’¡ https://t.co/5wU3jdp3A4". 

First, I'll break down the content. The author is talking about how in a busy and hectic world, books can be the best friends for someone who's lonely. They're using positive emojis like Earth globe, various book symbols, and a light bulb, which usually signifies an idea or inspiration.

The mention of "hustle bustle" suggests a fast-paced, stressful environment, but then they pivot to how books provide companionship. The use of words like "best friends" implies a sense of comfort and support. The overall tone seems positive because they're highlighting the value and joy that books bring, especially to someone feeling isolated.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or other. Since the tweet is celebrating books as companions and expressing relief from loneliness, it's likely conveying a positive emotion. The emojis used are also cheerful, which reinforces this.

I don't see any signs of negative emotions like anger or sadness here. It's more about finding solace and joy through reading. So, the primary emotion seems to be joy.
