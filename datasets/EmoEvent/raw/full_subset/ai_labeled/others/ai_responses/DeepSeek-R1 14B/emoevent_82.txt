Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says, "My Twitter feed is full of #JorahMormont Thank You, Goodbye and Farewell post. #GameOfThrones #BattleForWinterfell." 

First, let me break down what's happening here. The user is talking about their Twitter feed being filled with posts related to Jorah Mormont, specifically thanking him, saying goodbye, and farewell. They also mention the Game of Thrones hashtag and Battle for Winterfell.

Jorah Mormont was a character known for his loyalty and friendship with Daenerys Targaryen. His death in the series was emotional for many fans. So, when people are posting "Thank You, Goodbye, Farewell," it likely reflects their feelings about his departure.

The emotion here seems to be sadness because fans are expressing grief over losing a character they cared about. The use of hashtags like #GameOfThrones and #BattleForWinterfell also points towards the context of the show's ending or significant events, which often evoke strong emotions from the fanbase.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, joy, or surprise in this tweet. It's more about saying goodbye to a beloved character, so sadness fits best.
