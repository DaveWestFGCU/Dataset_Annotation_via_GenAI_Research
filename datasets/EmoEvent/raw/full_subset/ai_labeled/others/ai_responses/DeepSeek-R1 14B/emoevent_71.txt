Record: "So after 8,000 years we're supposed to believe that the biggest threat facing the seven kingdoms is simply defeated by a skinny assassin with a faint and dagger? Yeah...sorry GOT, but as much as I love you, GRRM would never have ended his books like this #gameofthrones #epicfail"

Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user is talking about how after 8,000 years, the biggest threat being defeated by a skinny assassin with a faint dagger seems unbelievable. They mention loving GOT but compare it unfavorably to GRRM's books, ending with #epicfail.

First, I notice words like "supposed," "faint dagger," and "epicfail." These suggest frustration or disappointment. The user is expressing dissatisfaction with how the series ended, especially comparing it to George R.R. Martin's books. They love the show but are critical of its ending.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger involves annoyance or rage; disgust is more about dislike or disinterest. Here, the user isn't just dislikesomething; they're reacting to what seems like a poor conclusion, which might be more frustration than pure disgust. However, frustration can sometimes lean towards anger because it's a strong negative emotion.

But wait, the tweet also includes love and appreciation ("as much as I love you"), so there's a mix of emotions. The primary one though is likely the criticism of the ending, which points to anger or maybe surprise if they're reacting to something unexpected. However, "epicfail" suggests disappointment rather than surprise.

So considering all this, the emotion seems to be more about frustration and dissatisfaction, which aligns with anger in the guidelines.
