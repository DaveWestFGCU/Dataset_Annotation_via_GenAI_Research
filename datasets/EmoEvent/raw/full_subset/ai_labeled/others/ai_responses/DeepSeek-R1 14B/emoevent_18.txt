Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about World Book Day. The tweet mentions a book club called "Read-to-Lead" that's helping children in rural areas improve their reading and writing skills. It also includes a hashtag for World Book Day and a link.

First, I'll break down the content. The tweet is talking about an initiative that's making a positive impact on kids' education. Using words like "helping," "improve," and the context of promoting reading and literacy suggests a positive sentiment. 

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or other. Joy seems to fit here because the tweet is sharing good news about an educational program benefiting children. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or sadness. The tone is uplifting and encouraging.

I don't see any elements that would point towards surprise either; it's more about a successful ongoing effort rather than something unexpected. So, the emotion here is likely joy because it's sharing positive news related to education and community impact.
