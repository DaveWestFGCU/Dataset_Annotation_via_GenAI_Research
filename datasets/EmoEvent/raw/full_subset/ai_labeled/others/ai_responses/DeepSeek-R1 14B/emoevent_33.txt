Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet is about World Book Day, which is an event promoted by UNESCO to encourage reading and book culture. The specific tweet says, "#WorldBookDay 'When in doubt, go to the library' [link]". 

First, let's break down the components of the tweet. It starts with a hashtag for World Book Day, which immediately tells me it's related to promoting books and reading. Then there's a quote: "When in doubt, go to the library." This seems like an encouraging or motivational statement. The author is likely trying to inspire others to seek knowledge or read more by suggesting the library as a resource.

Looking at the language used, there are no strong emotional words that convey anger, disgust, fear, etc. Instead, it's a positive and uplifting message. The quote itself doesn't express any negative emotions; instead, it's about guidance and support. The inclusion of a link probably leads to more information or resources related to reading, which further indicates a positive intent.

Considering the context provided, World Book Day is all about celebrating books and reading, so the tweet aligns with that theme. There's no indication of any negative feelings; on the contrary, it seems like an attempt to motivate others in a positive way.

Now, mapping this to the emotion labels: anger would require words indicating frustration or rage, which isn't present here. Disgust would involve dislike or aversion, but again, not applicable. Fear would imply anxiety or terror, which doesn't fit. Joy is about happiness or exhilaration—this tweet feels more on the encouraging side, so maybe joy? Sadness would require expressions of grief or pensiveness, which isn't here either. Surprise would be for unexpected emotions, but this is a straightforward message.

Wait, but the primary emotion might not necessarily be one of the top ones. The tweet is motivational and positive, but does it express joy? Or is it more neutral? Joy is about serenity or ecstasy, which seems a bit strong. Alternatively, maybe it's just a factual statement without much emotion—so perhaps 'other'?

But I think the author is trying to inspire, so there might be an underlying positive emotion. However, since the tweet doesn't explicitly express any of the primary emotions like joy through words but rather through encouragement, it's a bit ambiguous.

Given the guidelines, if the tweet conveys no emotion or multiple without a dominant one, classify as 'other'. Here, the message is more about promoting reading and libraries, which is positive but not necessarily expressing a clear emotion. So maybe 'other' is appropriate.
