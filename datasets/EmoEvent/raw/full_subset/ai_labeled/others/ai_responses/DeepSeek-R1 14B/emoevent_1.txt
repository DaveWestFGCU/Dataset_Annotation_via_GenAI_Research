Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says, "What a special team this Ajax team is and it’s going to broken up in the summer #ChampionsLeague #TOTAJA." 

First, let me break down the content. The author is talking about Ajax being a special team, which sounds positive—maybe expressing pride or joy. But then they mention that the team is going to be broken up in the summer. That part seems negative; it's like saying something good is going to end, which could bring sadness.

So, there are two parts here: praise for the team and a sad realization about its breakup. The first part might convey joy or pride, but the second part conveys more of a sense of loss or impending separation. Since emotions can be mixed, I need to determine which one is dominant.

The phrase "what a special team" suggests admiration, which could lean towards joy. However, the mention of being broken up in the summer indicates something negative—sadness about the team disbanding. The author might feel sad because a good team they care about is going to split up.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: sadness includes pensiveness or grief. This tweet seems to focus more on the loss aspect rather than any positive emotion, even though there's praise initially. The overall sentiment leans towards expressing that something good is ending, which aligns with sadness.
