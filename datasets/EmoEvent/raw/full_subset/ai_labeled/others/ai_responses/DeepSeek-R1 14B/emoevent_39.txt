Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user says they're a devoted follower of the Lord of Light because Melisandre's fire prayers were their only hope to see what was going on. They also mention hashtags like #GameofThrones and #NotToday.

Hmm, let me break it down. The tweet is expressing that the person turned to Melisandre's prayers as their main hope during a time when things were confusing or unclear on screen. The phrase "seeing what the hell was going on" suggests frustration or confusion. They felt lost and relied on these prayers for guidance.

So, the emotion here seems to be frustration because they're hoping for clarity but feeling let down by the situation. Frustration can sometimes overlap with other emotions like anger or surprise, but in this context, it's more about being annoyed or irritated due to confusion.

Looking at the guidelines, frustration falls under the secondary emotion of annoyance, which is classified as anger. So I think the primary emotion here is anger because they're expressing irritation and hopelessness regarding the show's clarity.
