Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Leo Messi. Let me read it again: "Leo oh Leo. Totally out of the world. The god of the game. 600 goals for the man. And one free kick from top tier." There are a bunch of hashtags too, like #Dios, which means God in Spanish, and others related to Barcelona FC and the Champions League.

Hmm, the language used is really praising Messi. Words like "totally out of the world," "god of the game," and mentioning 600 goals show admiration and awe. The exclamation marks and the use of "oh" add to the excitement. Also, hashtags like #Dios suggest reverence or worship towards him.

So, what emotion does this convey? It's definitely not anger, disgust, fear, or sadness. Those are negative emotions, and the tweet is full of positive praise. The mention of a free kick from top tier might refer to his skill, which again adds to the admiration.

Looking at the options: joy, surprise, or maybe even something else. Joy would fit because it's about happiness and pride in Messi's achievements. Surprise could be if there was an unexpected event, but here it's more about celebrating his skills and goals.

I think the emotion here is joy because the author is expressing admiration and happiness towards Messi's performance and accomplishments.
