Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let me read it again: "USER, please keep showing the way to a better world. I wish I could find your #ecofriendly products in Sweden. #CleanPlanetHealthyPeople  #GretaThunberg https://t.co/utpthPXqZe"

Hmm, the user is addressing someone, asking them to continue leading towards a better world. That sounds positive and encouraging. They express a desire to support eco-friendly products but mention they can't find them in Sweden. There's a slight disappointment there, maybe sadness because their wish isn't fulfilled yet.

Looking at the hashtags, #CleanPlanetHealthyPeople and #GretaThunberg are both related to environmental activism, which is generally positive and hopeful. The overall tone seems supportive and appreciative of the efforts being made. The user is encouraging others to keep going, which conveys a sense of hope and positivity.

I don't see any signs of anger or fear here. It's more about expressing support and a wish for availability of products, which might hint at some longing but not strong enough for sadness. The primary emotion seems to be joy because they're acknowledging the positive impact and encouraging continued efforts.
