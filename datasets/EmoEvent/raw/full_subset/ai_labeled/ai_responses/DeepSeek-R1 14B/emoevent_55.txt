Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Messi's free kick. Let me read it again: "When we played soccer as teens, the free kick that’s firmly placed at the corner of the net was called a mitre. #Messi is the king and the greatest of all time. Stunning free kick. #GOAT #BARLIV #UCL #ChampionsLeague"

Hmm, the tweet starts with a nostalgic memory about playing soccer as teens, mentioning something called a "mitre." Then it shifts to praise Messi, calling him the king and the greatest of all time. The key part is "Stunning free kick," which clearly expresses admiration or amazement.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to map this to one of these. The word "stunning" suggests something impressive and surprising. Also, using hashtags like #GOAT (Greatest Of All Time) and #UCL shows excitement about Messi's skill.

So the emotion here is likely surprise because it's highlighting an amazing moment that's unexpected or extraordinary in a positive way.
