Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire. The user provided a specific structure where they have to choose from anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, let me read the tweet carefully: "Macron's 'We will rebuild Notre-Dame in five years': a more modest version of Christ's 'Destroy the Temple, and I will rebuild it in three days!' #NotreDame #NotreDameCathedralFire #Macron"

The user is comparing Macron's statement to a biblical quote. The biblical reference is about rebuilding quickly after destruction, while Macron's plan is more modest with a five-year timeframe. 

I think the tweet might be expressing frustration or sarcasm towards Macron's response. By calling it "more modest," the author could be implying that Macron's timeline isn't ambitious enough compared to the religious text. This suggests some level of criticism or disappointment.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines, if the emotion is similar to annoyance or rage, it should be classified as anger. The sarcastic tone and comparison might indicate frustration, which falls under anger.
