Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The user provided a tweet from someone celebrating Barcelona winning La Liga. They used emojis like 😎 and 💖, which are pretty positive. The text mentions congratulations and says "Only Messi is real," showing excitement and pride.

Looking at the guidelines, joy includes emotions like serenity or ecstasy. The emojis and words here definitely show happiness and excitement, so I think it's joy.
