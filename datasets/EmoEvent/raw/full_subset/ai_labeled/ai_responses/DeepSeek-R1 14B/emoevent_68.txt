Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what emotion is conveyed in this tweet about World Book Day. The tweet says: "" Books to the ceiling, Books to the sky, My pile of books is a mile high. How I love them! How I need them! I’ll have a long beard by the time I read them.” – Arnold Lobel #WorldBookDay #WorldBookDay2019 #worldBookandCopyrightDay"

First, I notice that the author is talking about their pile of books being very large—so high it's like a mile. They mention loving and needing the books, which shows strong feelings towards them. The quote from Arnold Lobel also seems to express a deep affection for books.

The words "love" and "need" are key here. When someone says they love something, that usually indicates joy or happiness. The enthusiasm in the tweet, like mentioning the pile of books reaching the sky, adds to the positive emotion. There's no negative language; instead, it's all about celebration and excitement.

Looking at the context, World Book Day is meant to promote reading and books, so the author is likely celebrating this event by expressing their love for books. The hashtags also support a positive and celebratory tone.

Considering the mapping guidelines, joy is associated with emotions like serenity or ecstasy. While the tweet isn't serene, it's definitely filled with excitement and happiness about books. So, the primary emotion here seems to be joy.
