Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Greta Thunberg and her family. The user wants me to classify it into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, let's read the tweet carefully. It says, "The Thunberg's are the epitome of the disastrous modern family. Friendship based parenting. Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. Simply child abuse." The hashtags are #GretaThunberg and #Climatechange, but the main content is about the Thunbergs being a bad family.

Breaking it down: The tweet starts with "The Thunberg's are the epitome of the disastrous modern family." Using words like "disastrous" and "epitome" suggests strong negative feelings. Then it lists specific parenting styles and disorders, which are all negative terms. Ending with "Simply child abuse" is a harsh accusation.

So, what emotion does this convey? The language is very critical and uses strong terms to describe the family negatively. It's not just mild criticism; it's more like intense dislike or condemnation. Looking at the mapping guidelines: if the tweet conveys secondary emotions similar to disinterest, dislike, or loathing, we classify it as disgust.

I don't think it's anger because while there's criticism, it's more about expressing distaste rather than rage. Fear doesn't fit here; there's no sense of worry or anxiety. Sadness isn't the primary emotion eitherâ€”it's more about disapproval. Surprise is out of the question since nothing unexpected is mentioned.

Therefore, the emotion here is disgust because the author is showing strong dislike and condemnation towards the Thunberg family.
