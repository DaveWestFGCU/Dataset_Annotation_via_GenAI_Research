Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. The user provided some context about the ongoing dispute between Maduro and Guaido. Now, looking at the tweet itself: "Democratic, socialist, who cares if your whole business plan is to rape and pillage other countries for their resources because your capitalistic system is a complete failure. #Venezuela"

First, I notice strong language like "rape and pillage," which are intense metaphors. The speaker seems frustrated with the capitalist system, calling it a "complete failure." This frustration could be interpreted as anger. They're not just disagreeing; they're using harsh words to express their displeasure.

The hashtags don't add much in terms of emotion but support the context about Venezuela. The overall tone is critical and accusatory, which leans towards negative emotions. Since the guidelines mention that if it's similar to annoyance or rage, classify as anger. Here, the frustration and strong language definitely fit under anger rather than other categories like disgust or fear.

I don't see any elements pointing towards joy, surprise, or sadness. The focus is on criticizing a system, which is more about anger.
