Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says: "Also, who the fuck came up with that battle strategy, I genuinely can't think of a worse display #GameOfThrones". 

First, let's break down the language used. The person is using profanity ("who the fuck") which usually indicates strong emotions. They're questioning someone's decision-making regarding a battle strategy in Game of Thrones. The phrase "I genuinely can't think of a worse display" suggests they're expressing dissatisfaction or frustration with how the battle was handled.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet doesn't express any positive emotions like joy or serenity. It's not about fear or anxiety either. There's no mention of pensiveness or grief, so sadness isn't it. Surprise would be if they were amazed or something unexpected happened.

The key emotion here is frustration and disappointment. They're upset about the battle strategy, which aligns with anger because it's a strong negative reaction. The use of profanity and the critical tone reinforce that this is an angry sentiment rather than disgust (which might involve dislike but not necessarily frustration) or any other category.
