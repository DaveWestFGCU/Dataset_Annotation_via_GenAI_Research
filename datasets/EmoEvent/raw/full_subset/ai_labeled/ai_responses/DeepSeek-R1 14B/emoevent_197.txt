Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let's read it carefully.

The tweet says: "Messi with the best free kick ever!!!!! Holy shit!!!!! 3 nil barca! 游냃游놓 goats and some emojis. The hashtags are #Bar칞aLiverpool and #ChampionsLeague."

First, Messi is mentioned, who's a famous footballer. He's known for amazing skills, so a "best free kick ever" sounds impressive. The exclamation marks show excitement. Then "Holy shit!!!" which is an expression of surprise or amazement.

The score is 3-0 in favor of Barcelona (Barca). That's a significant win, especially against Liverpool, as seen from the hashtag #Bar칞aLiverpool. The user is clearly happy about this result.

Looking at the emojis: 游냃 is often used to represent Messi because he's called "El Gato" or something similar, and 游놓 might be playful, maybe showing surprise or admiration.

The hashtags also relate to the Champions League, which is a big competition, so winning would be a huge deal.

Putting it all together, the tweet expresses excitement about Messi's performance and Barcelona's victory. The use of "Holy shit" and multiple exclamation marks indicates strong positive emotions. So the primary emotion here is joy because they're celebrating an impressive win and a great moment in the game.
