Alright, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire and linked it to political issues in the US. They're comparing the response to the cathedral fire with other events like Flint, Puerto Rico, and the black churches. 

The author is clearly frustrated because they're pointing out what they see as unequal attention from the White House. The use of hashtags like #WhiteSupremacist and #KKK shows strong disapproval. So, the emotion here isn't just sadness or anger; it's more about disgust towards the policies and actions being criticized.

I think the primary emotion is disgust because they're expressing dislike and disapproval of how resources are being allocated based on political agendas rather than necessity.
