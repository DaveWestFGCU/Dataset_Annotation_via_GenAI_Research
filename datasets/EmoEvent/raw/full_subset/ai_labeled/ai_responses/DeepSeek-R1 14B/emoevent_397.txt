Record: "What we know so far about the #NotreDameCathedralFire #NotreDame   1. Smart people said Muslims did it b/c they have been destroying churches around the world 2. Looney Left labeled them ALL Alt-Right monsters 3. Deemed "accident" without investigation so The Crusades don't begin"

Okay, I need to determine the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet starts by listing three points. The first point mentions that some people are blaming Muslims for the fire because they've been destroying churches elsewhere. That sounds like a stereotype or prejudice, which might be frustrating or annoying to the author.

The second point says that the "Looney Left" labeled everyone as Alt-Right monsters. This seems like a criticism of how certain groups are being unfairly blamed or categorized, which could indicate frustration or anger.

The third point suggests that without proper investigation, people are assuming it's an accident to prevent any backlash, possibly referencing historical events like the Crusades. The author might be concerned about the implications of such assumptions, perhaps feeling fear about potential conflicts or misunderstandings.

Putting this together, the tweet is pointing out what they perceive as baseless accusations and political maneuvering regarding the fire. The tone seems critical and upset, more so than just surprise or sadness. It's more about frustration with how the situation is being handled by different groups.

So, considering the guidelines, frustration and annoyance fall under anger. Therefore, the primary emotion here is likely anger.
