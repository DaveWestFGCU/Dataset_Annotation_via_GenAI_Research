Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The tweet says "Happy #WorldBookDay! We invite you to use our collection of books, journals and media ðŸ“š To search ARCH's online Library Catalogue, go to https://t.co/chw28NC0a4 https://t.co/u9qyG3IoC2". 

First, the tweet starts with "Happy", which immediately makes me think of joy. They're celebrating World Book Day, so that's a positive event. The use of emojis like ðŸ“š also adds to the celebratory tone.

Looking at the content, they're inviting people to use their collection and providing links for access. This seems encouraging and welcoming, which are all signs of a positive emotion. There's no indication of any negative feelings or secondary emotions like anger or disgust here.

The context is about promoting reading and books, which is generally associated with happiness and enthusiasm. The author is sharing resources and information in an inviting manner, so the emotion conveyed is definitely joy.
