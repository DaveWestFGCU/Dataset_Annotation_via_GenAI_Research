Record: "Here’s another couple of images I shot inside Notre Dame Cathedral when I first visited Paris ten years ago. It really was a beautiful morning interior, here’s hoping she will be fully restored to her former glory. #NotreDame #NotreDameCathedralFire #NotreDameInterior https://t.co/Wm9LIbuqfJ"

Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user shared some old photos of the cathedral and expressed a wish for it to be fully restored. They used positive words like "beautiful morning interior" and ended with hopeful wishes.

First, looking at the content, they're reflecting on past memories but also showing concern for the future after the fire. The mention of hoping for restoration suggests a desire for things to return to how they were, which can indicate sadness or worry about the loss.

The hashtags used are related to the event and its impact, which might amplify feelings of sorrow or concern. However, there's no overt expression of anger or fear; instead, it seems more like a longing for what was lost.

Considering the guidelines, if the emotion is similar to pensiveness or grief, it falls under sadness. The tweet doesn't express joy because they're not celebrating but rather looking back with a sense of loss.
