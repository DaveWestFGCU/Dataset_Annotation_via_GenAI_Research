Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says, "It just feels fitting for Barca to win the #ChampionsLeague in Madrid." 

First, let's break down what's being said here. Barcelona (Barca) is a well-known football club, and they're talking about winning the Champions League, which is a big deal in European football. The tweet mentions that it "feels fitting" for Barca to win in Madrid.

The word "fitting" suggests that the author feels it's appropriate or right for Barcelona to achieve this victory. This likely reflects pride or satisfaction because their favorite team has succeeded in such an important competition, especially in a significant location like Madrid, which is another major city and home to Real Madrid, a rival club.

So, considering the emotions listed: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The emotion here isn't negative; it's more about positive feelings towards their team's success. "Fitting" implies approval and pride, which aligns with joy because they're happy about the outcome.

I don't think it's surprise because there's no indication of unexpectedness. It's more about the rightness of the situation rather than being amazed. Similarly, it's not fear or anger; those are negative emotions. Sadness doesn't fit either since the tweet is about a positive event.

Therefore, the emotion here should be joy.
