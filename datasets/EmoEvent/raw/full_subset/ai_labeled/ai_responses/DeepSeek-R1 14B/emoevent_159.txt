Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user wrote "#GameofThrones wow just wow, great battle and really feels like a movie and you just couldn't predict who was going to do and how it was going to end but the way the end it, wow #GamesOfThrones". 

First, I notice they used "wow" multiple times. That usually indicates surprise or amazement. The tweet is talking about a great battle that felt like a movie, which suggests something unexpected and impressive happened. They also mention not being able to predict who would do what or how it would end, which adds to the element of surprise because the outcome wasn't foreseeable.

The repeated use of "wow" emphasizes their reaction, likely showing they were amazed by the twist or the quality of the battle scene. There's no indication of anger, disgust, fear, or sadness here. It's more about being impressed and surprised by how the story unfolded.
