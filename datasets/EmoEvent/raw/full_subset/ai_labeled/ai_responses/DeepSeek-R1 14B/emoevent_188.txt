Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire. The user is a history nerd who's "beyond horrified" and mentions praying for France and the lost cathedral. They also say it was a dream of theirs to see Notre Dame.

First, let's break down the words used. "Horrified" is a strong emotion, indicating fear or terror. The tweet expresses distress over the loss of a historical site, which ties into fear because they're reacting to something tragic and possibly worrying about the consequences.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: Fear includes emotions like apprehension or anxiety. Here, the user isn't just sad; they're expressing horror, which leans more towards fear. The mention of praying suggests a sense of helplessness and concern, which are fear-related responses.

Other options like sadness could apply because losing something important can be悲伤，but the primary emotion here seems to be the shock and horror, which is fear.
