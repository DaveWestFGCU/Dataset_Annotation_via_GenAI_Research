Record: "USER #GretaThunberg why are you not proposing such simple and very effective solutions such as demanding the #US would immediately stop all its military involvement in wars all over the world?   Bombs and tanks are so much more harmful to the environment than family cars.  Money."

Okay, I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Greta Thunberg. The user is asking why she isn't suggesting simple solutions like stopping military involvement. They mention that bombs and tanks harm the environment more than cars and money.

Hmm, so the user seems frustrated or annoyed that Greta isn't addressing what they see as a bigger issue. That frustration could be classified under anger because it's a form of annoyance or irritation. There's no clear sign of other emotions like fear or surprise here; it's more about the criticism directed at her approach.

So, I think the emotion is anger.
