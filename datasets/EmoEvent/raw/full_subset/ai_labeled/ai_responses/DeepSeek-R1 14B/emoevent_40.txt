Record: "The #NotreDameCathedralFire is tragic. It obviously should be rebuilt but surely it was insured? Perhaps all those wealthy donors pledging money towards it, should instead set up a fund to help the victims of the Catholic paedophile network. They need rebuilding too."

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what emotion this tweet conveys about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user says it's tragic and mentions that it should be rebuilt. Then they question if it was insured and suggest that wealthy donors who pledged money for reconstruction should instead help victims of a Catholic paedophile network, implying those need rebuilding too.

Hmm, so the initial reaction is tragedy, which might lean towards sadness. But then there's an element of frustration or anger because the author is critical of how funds are being used. They're suggesting that the focus should be on helping victims rather than just rebuilding the cathedral. This could indicate a mix of emotions, but the primary one seems to be anger because they're expressing dissatisfaction and directing it towards the donors' priorities.

I think the key here is the sarcastic tone and the redirection of funds. The author isn't just sad about the loss; they're upset with how resources are being allocated, which points more towards anger than sadness.
