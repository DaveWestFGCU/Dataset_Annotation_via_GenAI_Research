Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Abu Dhabi International Book Fair. Let me read it again: "#AbuDhabi International Book Fair 2019 to begin tomorrow, #India to be the “Guest of Honour” country at the #BookFair. #ADIBF2019 #WorldBookDay #IndiaElects 🇮🇳"

Hmm, the tweet is announcing that the book fair is starting soon and India is the guest of honor. It's using a lot of hashtags related to books, the event, and even Indian elections. The emojis used are the flag of India, which might show pride or excitement.

I don't see any negative words here. Everything seems positive—celebrating literature, cultural exchange, and maybe national pride. There's no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or sadness. It's more about an event happening, so the emotion is likely joy because it's a celebration or something to look forward to.

Wait, but sometimes announcements can be neutral. But according to the guidelines, I have to choose from the given emotions and can't say neutral. So since it's promoting a positive event with excitement, I think joy fits best.
