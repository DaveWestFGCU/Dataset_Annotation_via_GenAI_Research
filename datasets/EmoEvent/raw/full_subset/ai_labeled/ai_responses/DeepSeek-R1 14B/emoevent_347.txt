Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet is about Venezuela's presidential crisis and includes hashtags like #WakeUpAmerica, #GUNcontrol, and mentions of Venezuela. 

First, let me break down the content. The user is linking to a video or article (the link shortens to "https://t.co/3TNIpHt3Kh") which I can't view here, but based on the hashtags, it seems they're concerned about gun control and the situation in Venezuela. 

The hashtags #WakeUpAmerica suggest an attempt to raise awareness or urgency among Americans. The mention of #GUNcontrol makes me think the user is linking gun control policies to making everyone a potential victim, possibly implying vulnerability or danger.

Now, considering the emotions: anger often comes from frustration or irritation. Dislike could be related to disgust, but here it's more about fear or anxiety. Fear would involve apprehension or terror, which might fit if the user feels threatened by gun control leading to more violence. Joy and surprise don't seem relevant here as there's no positive sentiment. Sadness could relate to grief over the situation, but the focus seems more on a call to action.

The primary emotion is likely fear because the user is warning about potential victimization due to gun control, which evokes feelings of danger or threat.
