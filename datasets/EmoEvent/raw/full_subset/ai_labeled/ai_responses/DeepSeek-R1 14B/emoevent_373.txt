Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is talking about donation pledges being already into the billions. Hmm, what's the sentiment here?

Well, the tweet mentions that people are donating a lot of money after the fire. That sounds positive because it shows support and generosity. But wait, the context is a tragic eventâ€”the cathedral was destroyed by fire. So, maybe the person is expressing something about how the community is responding.

The user wrote, "What I think of when I see the donation pledges..." It seems like they're reflecting on the outpouring of donations. The fact that it's already into billions might be surprising because such a large amount in a short time could be unexpected. So, surprise is an emotion related to amazement or being distracted by something unexpected.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: surprise includes emotions like distraction or amazement. Since the donations are massive and perhaps unexpected, the author's reaction seems to be one of surprise.
