Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Greta Thunberg. Let me read it again: "It must be said. #GretaThunberg has lit a fuse that will one day, I hope, be able to save every species of life on Earth. Otherwise, we really are doomed forever! Once we ignite the runaway greenhouse effect, game over people."

Hmm, the user is talking about Greta Thunberg lighting a fuse, which probably refers to her movement starting something big. They express hope that it will save all species but also warn that if things don't change, we're in serious trouble. The words "doomed forever" and "game over" sound really alarming.

I'm thinking about the emotions here. There's definitely a sense of urgency and worry about the future. The mention of being doomed suggests fear because they're talking about potential catastrophic events like the runaway greenhouse effect, which are scary and irreversible.

Looking at the guidelines, fear is associated with apprehension or anxiety. This tweet fits that because it's expressing concern about an impending environmental disaster. There's no anger or sadness explicitly stated; it's more about the dread of what might happen.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion here seems to be fear.
