Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says, "PAYMENT AFTER WINNING games are available, if you can stake high DM now!!! #BARLIV #ChampionsLeague #messi". 

First, let me break down the content. It mentions payment after winning games and talks about staking something, maybe money or something else, with a high DM (which could stand for Direct Message). The hashtags are related to Barcelona's rivalry ("BARLIV" likely short for Barça vs. Madrid), the Champions League, and Messi.

The tone seems excited because of the uppercase letters and exclamation marks. They're promoting some kind of payment or stake after winning games, which sounds like a betting offer or a promotional deal. The use of hashtags related to football clubs and competitions suggests they're targeting football fans, probably trying to create excitement around the Champions League.

The emotion here isn't negative; it's more about offering something positive—payment after wins—which could be seen as a good opportunity. So, the primary emotion is likely joy because they're sharing an exciting offer that people might find thrilling or happy news.
