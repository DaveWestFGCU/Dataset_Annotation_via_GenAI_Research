Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. The tweet is addressed to the Cuban regime, accusing them of meddling and playing a direct role in the crisis. Let me break it down.

First, the context mentions that there's been a presidential crisis since January 2019, with people divided between supporting Maduro and Guaido. So, the situation is tense and politically charged.

Looking at the tweet itself: it's using strong language like "meddling" and "man made crisis." The word "accusing" suggests that there's frustration or anger towards Cuba's involvement. The user is sending a "special message," which might be a veiled threat or a direct accusation, indicating不满 (discontent) with Cuban actions.

The hashtags "#Breaking" and the mention of #Cuba and #Venezuela suggest urgency and focus on the issue. The link provided likely leads to more information, but the main sentiment in the tweet is clear: frustration and anger towards Cuba's role.

Considering the emotion mapping guidelines, if the tweet conveys something similar to annoyance or rage, it should be classified as anger. Here, the user is expressing strong disapproval and blaming Cuba, which fits into the anger category rather than disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

I don't see any elements of fear (like anxiety or terror), joy, sadness, or surprise here. The primary emotion is definitely frustration and anger directed at Cuban interference.
