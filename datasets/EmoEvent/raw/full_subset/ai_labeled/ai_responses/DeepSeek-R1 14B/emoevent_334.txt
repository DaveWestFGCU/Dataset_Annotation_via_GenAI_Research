Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user mentions "mixed emotions" and talks about plot armor, which I know is a term used when characters are protected from harm in ways that seem unrealistic or frustrating to fans. They also quote a line from the show, which might be expressing some excitement or engagement with the content.

The tweet starts with "this moment perfectly captures the core of my mixed emotions on episode 3..." So they're feeling mixed emotions, but then they add "besides the plot armor." Plot armor usually refers to frustration because characters are protected in ways that don't make sense. So maybe their main emotion is frustration or annoyance.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: if it's similar to annoyance or rage, classify as anger. Since they're talking about plot armor and expressing mixed emotions, which includes frustration, I think anger fits here.
