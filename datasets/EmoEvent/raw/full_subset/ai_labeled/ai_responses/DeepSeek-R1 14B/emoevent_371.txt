Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet by Greta Thunberg. Let me read it again: "#Climatecrisis. Call it what it is, I hope we’re not too late to undo what we’ve done. #GretaThunberg #Takeaction #Actionworks https://t.co/5x7H8oJ6BO"

Hmm, the tweet starts with a hashtag about the climate crisis, which immediately makes me think of concern or worry. Then she says, "Call it what it is," which sounds like she's emphasizing the reality of the situation without any sugarcoating. That part feels serious and maybe a bit urgent.

Next, she writes, "I hope we’re not too late to undo what we’ve done." This line expresses a sense of urgency and worry about the possibility that it might be too late to fix the damage caused by climate change. The words "too late" suggest fear or anxiety because if they're too late, there could be severe consequences.

Looking at the hashtags she used: #GretaThunberg is her own movement, so that's just a tag. #Takeaction and #Actionworks seem to encourage others to join in, which shows she's proactive but also concerned about the situation.

Putting it all together, the overall tone seems worried and anxious about the climate crisis. She's not expressing anger or sadness directly; instead, her focus is on the urgency of taking action before it's too late. This aligns with fear because fear often involves a sense of impending danger or worry about future events.

I don't think she's feeling joyful here because there's no positive language. Disgust doesn't seem right either since she's not expressing dislike but rather concern. Surprise isn't applicable because there's nothing unexpected in the message. Sadness could be a possibility, but her emphasis is more on the urgency and potential negative outcomes rather than personal grief.

So, considering all this, I think the primary emotion here is fear.
