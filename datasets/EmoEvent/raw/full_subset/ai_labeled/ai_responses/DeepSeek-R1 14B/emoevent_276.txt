Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let's read it carefully.

The tweet is from someone talking about their experience with Twitter regarding tweets related to Greta Thunberg and Fridays for Future. They mention that almost every single one of their tweets on this topic has been reported. Then, they note that each time, Twitter investigated but found no violations of the rules. The hashtags used are #FridaysForFuture and #ClimateChange.

First, I should consider what emotions are associated with being reported frequently without any action from the platform. The person is likely frustrated because their tweets are getting reported, which might be seen as a form of suppression or at least unwanted attention. This frustration could stem from feeling ignored, targeted, or perhaps even persecuted for their stance on climate change.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: If the emotion is similar to annoyance or rage, it's anger. The frustration here seems to align with that category. There's no indication of disgust (dislike), fear (apprehension), joy (serenity), sadness (pensiveness), or surprise (amazement). The primary feeling expressed is more about being annoyed or irritated by the situation.

So, I think the emotion here is anger.
