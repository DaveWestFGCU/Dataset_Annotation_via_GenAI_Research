Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion behind it. The tweet says, "All hail the many faced God Arya Stark. She is forever that bitch! #GameOfThrones." 

First, I notice the use of "hail" which sounds like praise or admiration. Then, calling her a "many-faced God" suggests respect and maybe awe because she's known for being tricky and powerful in the show. The phrase "She is forever that bitch!" uses "bitch," which can be derogatory, but in this context, it might not be meant negatively. In Game of Thrones, Arya is often referred to as a "bitch" by others, so the author might be using it affectionately or to highlight her fierce personality.

The overall tone seems positive and celebratory. The hashtags also indicate excitement about the show. So, putting it all together, the emotion here is likely joy because the tweet expresses admiration and praise for Arya Stark.
