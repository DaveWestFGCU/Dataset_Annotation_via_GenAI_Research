Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The user wrote, "Why USER is one of the biggest assholes playing football?!?!#FCBLIV #ChampionsLeague #UEFAChampionsLeague #FCBarcelona". 

First, looking at the language used: they called someone an asshole, which is a strong insult. The use of multiple exclamation marks shows that they're really upset or angry. Words like "asshole" are definitely negative and convey frustration or rage.

The hashtags mentioned are related to football clubs, but the main content is about calling someone a name. So the emotion here isn't about the competition itself but about their personal feelings towards another user. The tone is clearly aggressive and filled with anger.

I don't see any signs of disgust, like describing something as恶心 (disgusting). There's no fear or anxiety mentioned. The tweet doesn't express joy or happiness; instead, it's full of irritation and rage. Sadness or pensiveness isn't present either. Surprise would be if they were amazed by something unexpected, but this is more about frustration.

So the primary emotion here is anger because of the strong negative language and the aggressive tone used towards another user.
