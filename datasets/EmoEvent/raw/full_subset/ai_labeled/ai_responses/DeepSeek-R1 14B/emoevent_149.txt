Alright, let's break down this tweet. The user starts with "I need to breathe," which suggests they're feeling overwhelmed or anxious. They mention "#GameOfThrones ain't no joke" and express that after 20 minutes, they're already shaking. These reactions indicate a strong emotional response, possibly fear or anxiety because of the suspense in the show.

The hashtags "#GOT freaking hell" add to the intensity, showing frustration or surprise at how intense it is. The repeated "ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±" emojis emphasize shock or astonishment. While there's frustration, the primary emotion seems to be the overwhelming feeling caused by suspense and tension, which aligns with fear.
