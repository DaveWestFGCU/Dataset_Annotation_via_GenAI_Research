Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user mentions that Flight 49 landed at Paris around 2:30 p.m., and they're grateful to passengers for sharing their stories. They also include a hashtag related to the cathedral fire.

First, gratitude is a positive emotion, which usually falls under joy or maybe surprise. But in this case, the tweet expresses thanks towards the passengers who shared their experiences during such an event. Gratitude typically conveys happiness or contentment, so that points towards joy.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise here. The user is expressing appreciation, which is a clear indicator of joy.
