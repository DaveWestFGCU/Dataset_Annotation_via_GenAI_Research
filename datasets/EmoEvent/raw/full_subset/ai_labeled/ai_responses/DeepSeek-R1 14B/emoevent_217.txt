Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. The user is talking about religious people feeling like gods and heaven not wanting anything to do with them while they aggrandize pointless violence. They also call them parasites.

First, let me break down the words used. "Love to be you" seems sarcastic. Then, calling them parasites shows disdain or dislike. The overall tone feels negative towards these religious people, suggesting frustration or irritation.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: secondary emotions similar to annoyance or rage fall under anger. Here, the user's sarcasm and use of strong words like "parasites" indicate a feeling of irritation or disgust. But wait, disgust is more about disliking something because it's seen as unclean or repulsive.

Hmm, but in this context, the user isn't expressing physical disgust but rather moral disgust towards their actions. So maybe that's still under disgust? Or does it fall under anger because of the frustration?

Wait, the guidelines say if it's similar to disinterest or dislike, classify as disgust. Since the tweet expresses strong dislike and disdain, I think it fits under disgust.
