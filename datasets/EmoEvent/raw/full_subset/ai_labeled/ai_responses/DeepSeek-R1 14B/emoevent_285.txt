Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. Let me read it again.

The tweet says: "Celebrate #TriviaTuesday with a pop quiz. How many children are impacted each week by Right To Play programs around the world? #Education #WorldBookDay"

Hmm, the author is encouraging people to participate in a trivia quiz related to education and Right To Play programs. They're using positive language like "Celebrate" and asking an engaging question. The hashtags also relate to promoting reading and education.

I don't see any negative words or signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise. It's more about sharing information in a fun way. So the emotion here is likely joy because they're trying to make something educational entertaining and positive.
