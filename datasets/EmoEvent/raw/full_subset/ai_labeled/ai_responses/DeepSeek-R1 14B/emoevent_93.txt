Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet is about Germany's right-wing populists, specifically the AFD party, who are denying climate change. They're trying to boost their support by working with scientists who claim that hysteria is driving the global warming debate. Additionally, they're mocking Greta Thunberg by calling her "mentally challenged" and a fraud.

Hmm, so the author is likely upset about this situation. The AFD is using denial and mockery against someone like Greta, who's known for her passionate advocacy on climate change. This seems to be a direct attack on both the movement and its leader.

The emotions here could include anger because the author might feel indignant or outraged at the actions of the AFD and their supporters. They're not just disagreeing; they're attacking Greta personally, which probably adds to the frustration.

I don't think it's disgust because while the behavior is distasteful, the primary emotion seems more about anger rather than disinterest or dislike. Fear doesn't seem right either because there's no indication of worry or anxiety in the tweet. Joy and surprise are clearly not applicable here since the content is negative. Sadness might be a possibility if it's about the state of affairs, but I think the stronger emotion here is anger due to the provocative actions described.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion conveyed is likely anger.
