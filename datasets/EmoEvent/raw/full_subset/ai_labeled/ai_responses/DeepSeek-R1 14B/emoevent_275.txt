Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire and wants me to classify the primary emotion conveyed in it using one of six labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says, "Notre Dame Will Be Repaired at Taxpayer Expense, but as a 'Shared Cultural Space'. And That Is How It Become a Mosque." The user also included some hashtags related to the event and their Twitter handle multiple times.

I need to determine the emotion here. The mention of repairing Notre Dame at taxpayer expense might indicate frustration or annoyance, which falls under anger. Additionally, the tweet suggests that Notre Dame will become a mosque, which could be seen as a negative change, possibly leading to disgust due to disapproval or dislike.

Looking deeper, the author seems critical of how funds are being used and perhaps opposes converting the site into a mosque. This criticism likely stems from strong negative feelings towards these decisions. The primary emotion here is probably anger because of the frustration expressed regarding taxpayer money and the proposed change in use.

I should also consider if there's any other emotion present, like fear or surprise, but the main sentiment seems to be directed at the handling of funds and the future use of the site, which points more towards anger.
