Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says, "#WorldBookDay This means I can buy more books!! Fantastic idea!!" Alright, let's break it down.

First, the mention of World Book Day is positive because it's an event promoting reading and books. The author is excited about buying more books, which shows they're happy or enthusiastic. They use exclamation marks to emphasize their excitementâ€”words like "Fantastic idea!!" definitely convey a strong positive emotion.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: joy includes emotions like serenity or ecstasy. Here, the person seems thrilled and happy about getting more books. There's no sign of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise. It's all about celebration and excitement.

So, the primary emotion here is joy because they're expressing happiness and enthusiasm about the event.
