Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The tweet says, "We save Notre Dame From the ravages of fire But the world still burns. #NotreDameCathedralFire #ClimateChange." 

First, let's break down the content. The user is talking about saving Notre Dame from a fire, which was a significant event. They mention that while they managed to save this iconic cathedral, the world is still burning, likely referring to broader issues like climate change.

The first part of the tweet seems positive because they're highlighting that Notre Dame was saved. Saving something important would naturally evoke feelings of relief or accomplishment, which might lean towards joy. However, the second part shifts the tone by pointing out that despite this success, global problems like climate change continue unchecked. This contrast could indicate a sense of frustration or disappointment.

Looking at the hashtags used: #NotreDameCathedralFire and #ClimateChange. The mention of climate change suggests the author is connecting the local event to a larger, ongoing issue they care about. This might imply that while there's some positivity in saving Notre Dame, there's also concern or worry about the bigger picture.

Considering the emotion mapping guidelines: If the tweet conveys secondary emotions like frustration or disappointment, those fall under anger. The author seems to be expressing frustration that despite efforts on one front (saving a building), larger issues remain unresolved. This frustration could be seen as a form of anger.

Alternatively, there's an element of sadness because the world is still in a problematic state, but I think the primary emotion here is more about the reaction to the situation rather than pure sadness. The emphasis seems to be on the ongoing issue despite a local success, which might lean towards frustration or anger.

So, putting it all together, the tweet combines elements of hope (saving Notre Dame) with concern or frustration (the world still burns). However, the stronger emotion conveyed is likely the frustration about the larger problem not being addressed, which aligns more with anger.
