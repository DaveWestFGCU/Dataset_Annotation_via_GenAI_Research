Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says, "The quality of barca jerseys are shit!!! #BARLIV #ChampionsLeague". Let me break it down.

First, the user is talking about Barcelona's (Barca) jerseys. They mention that the quality is "shit", which is a strong negative word. That immediately makes me think of disgust or anger. But let's see more context.

The hashtags are #BARLIV and #ChampionsLeague. BARLIV probably refers to FC Barcelona's kit for the 2014-15 season, known as the "shitkit" by fans due to its design. So the user is likely referring to that specific jersey.

Using "shit" indicates a strong dislike or dissatisfaction with the quality. Now, looking at the mapping guidelines: disgust includes disinterest, dislike, or loathing. Anger includes annoyance or rage. Here, the emotion seems more about disliking the product rather than being angry about it. So I think it's disgust.

Wait, but sometimes people express strong dislikes as anger. But in this case, since they're talking about quality and using a term of disdain, it leans towards disgust.
