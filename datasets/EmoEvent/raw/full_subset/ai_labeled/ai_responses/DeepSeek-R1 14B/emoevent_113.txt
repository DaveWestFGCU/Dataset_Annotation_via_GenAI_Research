Record: "Imagine how quickly #FlintMichigan would have water if USER donated the same $5M pledged to #NotreDameCathedralFire. Imagine what brilliant architects weâ€™d inspire if we cared enough to give folks the resources they deserve; are OWED. #ChildrenAreChurches #defendthesacred"

Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is comparing Flint Michigan's water situation to the donations for Notre Dame. They mention that if USER donated $5M like pledged to Notre Dame, Flint would have water quickly. They also talk about inspiring architects and caring enough to give resources people deserve, which they feel are owed. The hashtags include #ChildrenAreChurches and #defendthesacred.

Hmm, the tweet seems critical of the disparity in donations. The user is pointing out that while a lot was pledged for Notre Dame, Flint hasn't received similar support. This could be expressing frustration or anger towards the lack of attention to Flint's issues compared to Notre Dame. They're highlighting a social justice angle, emphasizing that children and communities deserve resources too.

So, looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: if it's about annoyance or rage, classify as anger. The tweet does seem to express frustration and possibly anger towards the situation where more attention is given to a historic site over people in need.
