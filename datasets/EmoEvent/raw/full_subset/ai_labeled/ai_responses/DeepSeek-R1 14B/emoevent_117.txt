Record: "The amount of people complaining about people being sad about the Notre Dame is absurdly worrying. Why can't you feel sad that a part of history (and art/architecture not to mention religious to some) has been irreversibly damaged? #NotreDameCathedralFire #NotreDame"

Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is frustrated with people who aren't expressing sadness over the destruction. They're calling it "absurdly worrying" and question why others can't feel sad about such a significant loss.

First, let's break down the words used. Words like "complaining," "absurdly worrying," and "Why can't you feel sad" show that the author is upset or annoyed with others' lack of empathy. This points towards anger because they're expressing frustration at others' insensitivity.

The tweet also mentions that a part of history, art, architecture, and religion has been damaged, which indicates a deep concern about the loss. However, the primary emotion isn't sadness for themselves but rather irritation directed at others not sharing their sentiment. So while there's an element of sadness about the event itself, the main emotion conveyed is more about the frustration with others' reactions.

I should consider if any other emotions fit better. Disgust might be a possibility because they're expressing disapproval, but disgust usually involves feelings like dislike or aversion towards something. In this case, it's more about frustration and irritation towards people's lack of empathy, which aligns more with anger.

Fear isn't present here; there's no indication of worry or anxiety beyond the initial event. Joy and surprise are clearly not applicable since the context is a tragic event. Sadness is part of the mix but secondary to the frustration expressed towards others.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion is anger because the author is frustrated with how others are reacting (or not reacting) to the tragedy.
