Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The user wrote, "Yes !! #Parents4future in support of #Fridaysforfuture and #SchoolStrike4Climate #GretaThunberg #globalstrike." 

First, looking at the words used: "Yes" with exclamation marks shows excitement or agreement. The hashtags are all related to supporting climate strikes, which suggests they're backing a cause they believe in. The mention of Greta Thunberg and various climate strike movements indicates a positive stance towards environmental activism.

The emotion here isn't negative; there's no anger or disgust expressed. Instead, the user is expressing support and enthusiasm for the movement. So, considering the guidelines, joy would be the appropriate label because it aligns with feelings of excitement and agreement in a positive context.
