Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user is only on season 1 and is questioning why others call Arya Stark a Mary Sue. Hmm, "Mary Sue" usually refers to a character that's overly perfect or has no flaws, which can be seen as annoying or frustrating.

The guidelines say if it's similar to annoyance or rage, classify as anger. So the user seems annoyed by people calling Arya a Mary Sue. They might feel frustrated because they're just starting and hearing criticism about a character they probably like. There's no clear sign of other emotions like fear or joy here. It's more about irritation with others' opinions.

So I think the emotion is anger.
