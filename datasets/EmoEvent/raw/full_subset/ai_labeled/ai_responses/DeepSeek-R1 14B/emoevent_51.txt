Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The user is talking about how books provide knowledge and information that the internet can't, and they mention that books are a primary source of various things like facts, fiction, knowledge, and wisdom. 

First, looking at the language used, it's positive and appreciative. Words like "knowledge," "information," "facts," "fictions," "wisdom" all have positive connotations. The user is highlighting the value and importance of books.

I should consider each emotion category: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. 

- Anger or disgust don't seem to fit because there's no negative language.
- Fear isn't present either; the tweet doesn't express any anxiety or terror.
- Sadness is also not indicated; the tone is uplifting.
- Surprise might come into play if something unexpected was mentioned, but here it's more of a celebration.
- Joy seems appropriate because the user is expressing appreciation and highlighting the positive aspects of books.

So, the primary emotion is joy. The tweet conveys a sense of happiness and commendation towards books and their role.
