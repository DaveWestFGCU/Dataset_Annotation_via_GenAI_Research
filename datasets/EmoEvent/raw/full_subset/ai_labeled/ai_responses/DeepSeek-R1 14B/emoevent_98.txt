Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about World Book Day. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet starts with "#WorldBookDay" which is just a hashtag for context. Then the author says, "i was in love with reading before i was finished learning how to." The phrase "in love with reading" immediately makes me think of joy or happiness because being in love usually conveys positive emotions.

Next, they mention their journey from baby books to becoming a bibliophile, which is someone who loves books. Using words like "lucky in my eyes" reinforces the positive feelingâ€”they see their journey as fortunate and happy.

They also talk about reading entire books and novels during preschool, showing enthusiasm and pride in their early achievements. The overall tone is one of fond memories and appreciation for reading, which again points towards joy.

I don't detect any negative emotions like anger or sadness here. It's all about the positive experiences related to reading. So, considering the guidelines, the emotion that fits best is joy.
