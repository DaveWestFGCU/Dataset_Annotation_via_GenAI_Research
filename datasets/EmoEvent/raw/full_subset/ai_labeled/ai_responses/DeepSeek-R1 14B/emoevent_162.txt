Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. The tweet says, "#Venezuela When tyranny becomes law, rebellion is a right. Simon Bolivar." 

First, let me break down the components of the tweet. The hashtag #Venezuela indicates it's related to events happening there. The main message is "When tyranny becomes law, rebellion is a right," which seems to be a strong statement against oppressive governance. It's referencing Simon Bolivar, who was a prominent Venezuelan revolutionary leader known for his fight against Spanish colonial rule and advocacy for independence and democracy.

The phrase "tyranny becomes law" suggests that the current government is seen as tyrannical or oppressive. The response of rebellion being a right implies defiance and resistance against such tyranny. This kind of language often conveys strong emotions like anger or frustration, but I need to determine which one fits best according to the guidelines.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: Anger includes secondary emotions like annoyance or rage. Disgust is for disinterest or dislike. Fear relates to apprehension or anxiety. Joy is about serenity or ecstasy. Sadness covers pensiveness or grief. Surprise is for distraction or amazement.

The tweet expresses a call to resist tyranny, which likely reflects the author's strong opposition and possibly anger towards the situation in Venezuela. The mention of Simon Bolivar adds historical context, emphasizing the struggle against oppressive rule, which can be seen as a passionate stance rather than one filled with fear or surprise.

I don't think it's disgust because there's no clear indication of dislike without passion. Fear might come into play if the tweet were about anxiety over the situation, but here it seems more about taking a stand. Sadness would involve grief, which isn't directly expressed. Surprise is more about unexpected events, not so much here.

So, considering all this, the emotion conveyed is likely anger because of the strong stance against tyranny and the call for rebellion.
