Okay, I need to determine the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user wrote, "It’s amazing how quickly people can collect so much money to fix a building when there is so much pain and suffering in the world #NotreDameCathedralFire." 

First, let's break down the words used. The word "amazing" typically conveys surprise or astonishment. However, the context here is about people donating money quickly after a disaster. While it might seem positive at first glance, the tweet also points out that there's still a lot of pain and suffering in the world, which adds a critical edge.

The user seems surprised by the rapid fundraising but is questioning why so much attention and money are being directed towards rebuilding a building while other issues persist. This suggests a sense of disbelief or astonishment, which falls under surprise. However, there's also an underlying tone of criticism, which could hint at another emotion like anger or disgust.

But according to the guidelines, if the emotion is similar to distraction or amazement, it should be classified as surprise. The primary reaction here seems to be the astonishment at how quickly money was raised, even though it's paired with a critique of global suffering. So, focusing on the "amazing" part, which directly relates to surprise.
