Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user mentioned that the fire reminded them of a paragraph from their work on the kingdom as a space and that people mourn because spaces are not static but active. They also included relevant hashtags.

First, let's break down the content. The tweet is reflecting on the fire at Notre-Dame, which was a significant event causing widespread sadness and loss. The author connects this to their own work, suggesting that the destruction of such a space leads people to mourn because these spaces aren't staticâ€”they have an active role in people's lives.

The key words here are "mourn" and "active." Mourning typically relates to sadness or grief. The author is expressing that the loss of Notre-Dame as a space causes people to feel this way, indicating a sense of sorrow or pensiveness about the event.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: if the emotion is similar to pensiveness or grief, it falls under sadness. There's no indication of anger, disgust, fear, joy, or surprise in the tweet. The focus is on the emotional response to the loss of a significant space, which aligns with sadness.
