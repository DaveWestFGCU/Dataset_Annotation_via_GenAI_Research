Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let me read it carefully. The tweet says, "It's over!!!! #Barcelona are #LaLiga champions again!!!! #BarçaLevante." 

First, the use of multiple exclamation marks suggests excitement or strong positive feelings. The word "over" might indicate that something significant has concluded, but in this context, it's likely referring to the end of a competition where Barcelona won.

The hashtags "#Barcelona," "#LaLiga champions again," and "#BarçaLevante" all point towards celebrating a victory. So the author is expressing joy because their favorite team has won the league again. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or sadness here. The tone is clearly positive and celebratory.

Looking at the mapping guidelines, joy includes emotions like serenity or ecstasy, which fits perfectly with this tweet. The author seems thrilled and happy about the achievement.
