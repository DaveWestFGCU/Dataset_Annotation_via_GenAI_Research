Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet and classify it into one of the given categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me start by reading the tweet carefully.

The tweet says: "Excellent speech from Clive Lewis MP. Every MP should have been present at this debate. A Climate Emergency must be declared. #ExtinctionRebellion #GretaThunberg #LabourGreenRebellion https://t.co/MTz1xVGpAR"

First, the author is praising Clive Lewis MP's speech by calling it "Excellent." That word has a positive connotation, suggesting approval or satisfaction. They also mention that every MP should have been present at the debate, which implies they're disappointed or upset that not everyone attended. However, disappointment might lean towards sadness or anger.

Next, they state that a Climate Emergency must be declared. This is a strong statement indicating urgency and concern about climate issues. The hashtags used are #ExtinctionRebellion, which I know is associated with environmental activism, often linked to Greta Thunberg's movement. The other hashtag is #LabourGreenRebellion, suggesting political engagement.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: If the tweet conveys a secondary emotion similar to pensiveness or grief, it should be classified as sadness. Here, the author seems concerned about the climate situation and perhaps frustrated that more MPs didn't attend the debate. However, their main expression is approval of the speech and advocacy for action.

The word "excellent" clearly shows positive sentiment, which aligns with joy or maybe surprise if something unexpectedly good happened. But in this context, it's more about agreement and support rather than a surprising event. The call to declare a Climate Emergency adds urgency but doesn't necessarily convey fear or anger; instead, it's a call to action.

Considering the options, "excellent" suggests joy because they're expressing satisfaction with the speech. There's no indication of surprise, as there's nothing unexpected mentioned. Disappointment about MP attendance could hint at sadness, but the overall tone is more positive and supportive.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion here seems to be joy because of the praise for the speech and the support for climate action.
