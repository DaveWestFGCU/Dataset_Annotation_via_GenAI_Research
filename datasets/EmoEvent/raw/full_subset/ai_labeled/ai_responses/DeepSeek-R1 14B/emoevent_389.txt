Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user mentions World Heritage Day and reflects on their nation's vibrant history. They compare it to the swift action taken after the Notre Dame fire and suggest rethinking heritage preservation.

Hmm, the tweet seems positive because they're highlighting their national heritage and suggesting proactive steps. Words like "vibrant" and "rich" are uplifting. The mention of taking swift action implies a sense of urgency but in a constructive way. They're not expressing any negative emotions; instead, they're encouraging others to take positive actions.

So the emotion here is likely joy because they're celebrating their heritage and promoting preservation, which are positive sentiments.
