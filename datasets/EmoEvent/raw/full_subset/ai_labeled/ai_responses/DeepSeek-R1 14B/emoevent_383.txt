Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Messi's free kick. The user provided a detailed context about the UEFA Champions League and then gave the tweet itself. My task is to classify the emotion into one of six categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, let me read the tweet carefully. It says, "How did #Messi score this long range free kick 🤷🏾♂️🤷🏾♂️🤷🏾♂️. He is the 🐐🐐🐐🐐 goats 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐 #BarcaLiverpool #FCBLIV #ChampionsLeague." 

The tweet starts with a question expressing disbelief about how Messi scored such a difficult free kick. The repeated goat emojis (🐐) are often used to signify that someone is the "GOAT," which stands for Greatest Of All Time. So, the author is clearly impressed by Messi's skill.

Looking at the reaction emojis 🤷🏾♂️, these are face palm or shrug emojis, indicating confusion or astonishment. The combination of the question and the repeated goat emojis suggests admiration and amazement.

Now, mapping this to the emotion categories: The primary emotion here is surprise because the author is amazed at Messi's ability. While there might be some joy in supporting Messi or the team, the dominant feeling expressed through the reaction and the questioning is surprise due to the unexpectedness of the goal.

I should also consider if any other emotions could apply. There's no sign of anger, disgust, fear, or sadness. The repeated use of emojis and hashtags related to Messi being the best points towards admiration, which falls under surprise because it's an expression of astonishment at his talent.
