Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet says: "'Don' t litter' 'Care about the eath' This really gave me hope for the future. Perhaps a child made this? Future vegan? ❤️ #hope #dontlitter #earth #motherearth #veganvibes #enviroment #gretathunberg @ Løten https://t.co/Ipzk2ZLC1m"

First, I notice that the author is talking about a message that says "Don't litter" and "Care about the earth." They mention that this gave them hope for the future. The use of words like "hope" and the heart emoji indicate positive feelings.

The author also speculates if a child made the message, suggesting innocence or youthfulness, which is often associated with positivity and optimism. Additionally, they refer to becoming a "future vegan," which ties into environmentalism and sustainability—topics that are typically linked with hope and proactive attitudes.

Looking at the hashtags: #hope, #dontlitter, #earth, etc., all reinforce themes of positivity and concern for the environment. The mention of Greta Thunberg, who is known for her activism and inspiring many, including young people, further supports an emotional tone of hope and optimism.

The overall message seems to be about environmental awareness and the positive impact even small actions can have. The author feels hopeful because they see efforts like this as a sign of change and a better future.

Considering the emotion categories: anger is out since there's no frustration or rage. Disgust isn't present; instead, it's appreciation. Fear doesn't fit here either—there's no sense of dread. Joy could be a contender, but the tweet focuses more on hope than pure joy. Sadness isn't applicable because the tone is uplifting. Surprise might come into play if there was an unexpected event, but here it's more about inspiration.

Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed is hope, which falls under the category of joy or perhaps surprise? Wait, no—hope is a form of positive expectation, so it aligns with joy. But looking back at the mapping guidelines: joy includes serenity or ecstasy, while hope might be more aligned with pensiveness or grief if it's about longing for something better. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the tweet expresses optimism and positivity, which is best captured by "joy." Alternatively, since they're inspired and feel hopeful, perhaps "surprise" isn't the right fit because there's no astonishment. It's more of a positive outlook on the future, so joy makes sense.
