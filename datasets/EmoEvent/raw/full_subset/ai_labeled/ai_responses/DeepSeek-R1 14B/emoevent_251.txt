Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Barcelona winning against Liverpool with a score of 1-0, thanks to Suarez's goal. The user is asking me to classify it into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, let's break down the tweet. It says "1 - 0 to Barca!!" which immediately shows excitement because of the exclamation marks and the score indicating a win. The mention of Suarez scoring his first Champions League goal of the season adds to the positive sentiment. Words like "first" and "came at a great time" suggest that this was a significant and timely moment, adding to the celebratory tone.

The hashtags used are "#ChampionsLeague" and "#BARLIV." The latter is likely short for Barcelona vs Liverpool, which further indicates the context of the match. These hashtags don't add negative connotations but rather highlight the event's importance.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: joy includes emotions like serenity or ecstasy. In this case, the tweet expresses excitement and happiness about a win, which fits under joy. There are no signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise here. The user is clearly happy about the outcome.

I should also consider if there's any possibility of another emotion. Could it be surprise? Well, surprise usually involves something unexpected. If Suarez's goal was a last-minute winner, maybe, but the tweet doesn't specify that it was unexpected. It just mentions it came at a great time, which is more about positive timing than surprise.

Therefore, the primary emotion here is joy because of the celebratory tone and excitement about the win.
