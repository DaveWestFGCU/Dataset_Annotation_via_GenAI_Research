Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet for classification. Let's break it down.

The tweet starts with "Over 200 followers that's super awesome guys!!!". The use of words like "super awesome" and exclamation marks suggests excitement or happiness. The author is expressing gratitude towards their followers, mentioning they appreciate everything the followers do and put up with their "unique brand of crazy." This sounds positive and appreciative.

The hashtags used are #ThanksaBillion, which conveys thanks, #WorldBookDay related to a book event, #follobackforfolloback which is about following others on social media, and some other unrelated ones. The overall tone seems upbeat and thankful.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: joy includes emotions like serenity or ecstasy. Here, the author's excitement and gratitude fit well under joy. There are no signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise in the tweet.
