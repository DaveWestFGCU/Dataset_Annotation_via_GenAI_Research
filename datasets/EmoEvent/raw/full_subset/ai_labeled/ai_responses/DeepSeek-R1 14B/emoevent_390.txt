Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says, "Congrats to Messi on 600 goals. Glad he did it against USER #BarcaLiverpool #ChampionsLeague." 

First, let's break down the content. The user is congratulating Messi on reaching 600 goals and expressing that they're glad it happened against a specific team, which I assume is Barcelona vs. Liverpool based on the hashtags.

The main emotion here seems to be happiness or joy because they're congratulating someone and expressing gladness about an achievement. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or sadness. The use of "Congrats" and "Glad" clearly shows a positive sentiment.

I don't think it's surprise because there's nothing unexpected mentioned, just a celebration of Messi's milestone. It's not fear or disgust either; those would involve more negative language. Sadness isn't present since the tweet is about a positive achievement.

So, considering all this, the emotion here is joy.
