Record: "We see #Billionaires rushing to donate money to #NotreDameFire #NotreDameCathedralFire. But I would wager they are not contributing to groups like USER. Why not? Simple. Most of them likely became billionaires profiting from the corporations who have created this mess."

Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is talking about how billionaires are donating money but aren't contributing to other groups, like USER. They suggest that these billionaires made their money by profiting from corporations causing problems.

Hmm, let's break it down. The tweet seems critical of the billionaires' actions. They're pointing out a discrepancy between donations to Notre Dame and support for other causes. The tone here feels more like frustration or irritation rather than any other emotion. It's not fear because there's no indication of worry or anxiety. There's no joy or surprise; it's more about the unfairness they perceive.

So, considering the mapping guidelines, secondary emotions similar to annoyance or rage fall under anger. This tweet definitely has that critical and annoyed tone towards the billionaires' priorities. I don't think it's disgust because it's not about dislike for something恶心 (disgusting) but rather frustration with their behavior.

Therefore, the emotion here is likely anger.
