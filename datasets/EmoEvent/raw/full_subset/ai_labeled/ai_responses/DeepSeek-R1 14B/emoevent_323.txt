Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says, "Amazing how good game research is! #game #gamedev #research #NotreDameCathedralFire https://t.co/h9u8L8YhSR". 

First, looking at the main part of the tweet: "Amazing how good game research is!" The word "amazing" suggests a positive emotion. It's expressing surprise or astonishment about something related to game research.

Now, considering the context given earlier about the Notre Dame Cathedral Fire on April 15, 2019. That event was tragic and would likely evoke strong emotions like sadness or fear. However, in this tweet, the user is talking about game research and using the hashtag #NotreDameCathedralFire. 

I wonder if the mention of the cathedral fire is just a coincidence or if it's related. The main content of the tweet is about game research being amazing, so I think that's the primary focus here. The hashtags might be for broader reach but don't necessarily add emotional context.

The emotion expressed in "amazing" falls under surprise because it's an exclamation showing astonishment. There's no indication of anger, disgust, fear, or sadness in the tweet itself. It's more about celebrating something positive related to game research.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion is surprise.
