Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The user wrote, "Happy World Book Day... the international day of the humble book." They also included some relevant hashtags and a link.

First, looking at the words used: "Happy" is a strong indicator of joy. The mention of celebrating books and using positive language like "humble" suggests they're feeling good about it. There's no negative or neutral language here; everything seems upbeat and celebratory.

The context given mentions that World Book Day promotes reading, which aligns with the happy tone. The user is likely expressing excitement or satisfaction related to literature and community, which falls under joy.
