Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet starts with "Happy #WorldBookDay from me & mine to you & yours ‚ù§Ô∏èüìö‚ù§Ô∏è". The use of "Happy" and heart emojis immediately suggests a positive feeling. They're expressing joy towards others, which is a good sign pointing towards the 'joy' category.

Next, they thank various groups like readers, writers, etc., using a lot of exclamation marks and warm language. This reinforces the idea that they're feeling happy and appreciative. The hashtags also seem celebratory, like #WeOughtaKnow and #BuffyBio, which probably relate to book culture or community.

There's no negative language here; everything is positive and uplifting. They're celebrating books and the people involved in the book industry. No signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise‚Äîjust pure enthusiasm and happiness.

So, considering all these elements, the emotion conveyed is definitely joy.
