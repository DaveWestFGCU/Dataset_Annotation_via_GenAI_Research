Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says, "Good news regarding our #pollinator friends: https://t.co/2ZhcBQfhIe #NotreDameCathedralFire." 

First, let's break down the components of the tweet. The user starts with "Good news," which immediately suggests a positive tone. They're talking about their "#pollinator friends," and there's a link attached, probably leading to more information on that topic. Pollinators are important for ecosystems, so sharing good news about them could indicate happiness or excitement.

However, the tweet also includes the hashtag #NotreDameCathedralFire. This refers to the tragic event where the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris caught fire on April 15, 2019. That was a significant and saddening event for many people around the world. So why is this hashtag included here?

Looking at the structure of the tweet, it's combining two unrelated topics: pollinators (which are positive) and the Notre-Dame fire (a negative event). The user might be trying to contrast good news with a tragedy or perhaps using the hashtags for some other reason, like trending topics.

But focusing on the emotion conveyed, the primary part of the tweet is about "good news," which suggests joy. The mention of the cathedral fire doesn't seem to add an emotional layer here; it's more of a contextual tag. Unless the user is trying to juxtapose the two, but without additional context or words expressing sadness or concern, I don't think the emotion is tied to that event.

So, considering all this, the primary emotion seems to be joy because they're sharing good news about pollinators. The inclusion of the Notre-Dame fire hashtag doesn't change the emotional tone of the tweet itself.
