Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The tweet is titled "Episode 83 - Got Money For War But Can't Feed The Poor" and includes several hashtags like #NotreDameCathedralFire, #Brexit, #Farage, #WealthDistribution, along with podcast-related tags.

First, I notice the main topic seems to be about funding priorities. The tweet is pointing out that money is allocated for war but not for feeding the poor. This suggests frustration or criticism towards current policies or spending decisions. 

The mention of the Notre Dame Cathedral fire might be a way to tie in current events with the broader discussion on resource allocation, possibly indicating disappointment or anger at how resources are being used.

Looking at the hashtags, #WealthDistribution and #Brexit could imply discussions about economic inequality and political issues, which often come with strong emotions. The inclusion of podcast-related tags might mean this is part of a series discussing these topics, but the main sentiment seems to be critical.

Considering the emotion mapping guidelines: if it's frustration or criticism related to funding decisions, that falls under anger because it's a form of annoyance or rage directed at the situation.
