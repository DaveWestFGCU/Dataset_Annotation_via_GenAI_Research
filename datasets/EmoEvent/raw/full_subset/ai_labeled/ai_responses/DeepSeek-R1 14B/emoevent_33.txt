Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user provided a detailed context and specific guidelines for mapping emotions into one of six categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Looking at the tweet, it's talking about a glimmer of hope regarding the survival of three 13-century stained glass windows. The author mentions that all three appear to have been saved and quotes the Culture Minister saying they don't seem to have suffered catastrophic damage. The overall tone seems positive because despite the tragedy of the fire, there's good news about these important cultural artifacts being preserved.

The guidelines mention that if the emotion is similar to serenity or ecstasy, it should be classified as joy. In this case, the tweet expresses hope and relief, which are positive emotions fitting under joy. There's no indication of any negative feelings like anger or sadness here; instead, it's a hopeful update.
