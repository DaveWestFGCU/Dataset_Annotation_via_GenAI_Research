Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet says: "What a night for #Barcelona! #Messi reaches 600 career goals by scoring a free kick out of this world and the #Catalans take the advantage in first leg of 1/2 final against #Liverpool!   #ucl #BarçaLFC #championsleague https://t.co/gAOFKZsDt5"

Alright, breaking it down. The author is talking about Barcelona having a great night. Messi has reached 600 career goals with an incredible free kick, and they're taking the lead against Liverpool in the Champions League semi-final.

The language used here is very positive. Words like "What a night," "out of this world," and "take the advantage" all suggest excitement and happiness. The mention of Messi's milestone achievement adds to the celebratory tone.

I don't see any negative words or sentiments here. It's all about success, achievement, and a positive outcome in a crucial match. So the emotion is definitely on the positive side.

Looking at the options: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet doesn't express any of the first three. There's no indication of fear or anxiety; instead, it's about triumphing over a tough opponent.

The closest emotions are joy and surprise. But is it more about joy because of the success and celebration, or surprise because of an unexpected event? In this case, while Messi scoring 600 goals is impressive, it might not be entirely surprising if he's known for his skills. The overall tone seems more celebratory than surprised.

So I think the primary emotion here is joy.
