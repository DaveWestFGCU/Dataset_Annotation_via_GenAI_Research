Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says: "Well said! üëè lets see how he would do in #LaLiga or #BPL which I'd love to see! https://t.co/n26G0nH1eK". 

First, let's break down the components of the tweet. The user starts with "Well said!" and uses a thumbs-up emoji üëè, which is commonly associated with approval or agreement. They then express interest in seeing how someone would perform in two different football leagues: LaLiga and BPL (which I know stands for Barclays Premier League). They end with an excited statement saying they'd love to see that.

The overall tone seems positive. The use of emojis like the thumbs-up and the exclamation mark indicate enthusiasm. The mention of wanting to see how someone would do in these leagues suggests curiosity or eagerness, which are positive emotions. There's no indication of any negative feelings like anger or disgust here.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: joy is associated with serenity or ecstasy, but it can also encompass excitement and happiness. Since the tweet expresses approval and a desire to see something happen, which brings about positive feelings, I think the emotion here is joy.
