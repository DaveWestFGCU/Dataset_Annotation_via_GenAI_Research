Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let's see, the tweet says, "The Champion of Spain! Congratulations USER #LaLiga." The user is celebrating someone being champion, probably happy about it.

Looking at the guidelines, joy is associated with emotions like serenity or ecstasy. This tweet seems positive and congratulatory, which fits into joy. There's no sign of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise here. It's all about celebration.
