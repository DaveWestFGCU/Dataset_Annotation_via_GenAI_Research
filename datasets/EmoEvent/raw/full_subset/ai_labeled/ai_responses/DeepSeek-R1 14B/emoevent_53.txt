Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says, "#Venezuela #Israel and #America are gone, the world is in peace." Hmm, let's break it down.

First, the context given is about Venezuela's presidential crisis, which has been ongoing since January 10th, 2019. It mentions that the nation and the world are divided between supporting Nicolas Maduro or Juan Guaido. So, there's a lot of tension and conflict going on in Venezuela.

Now, looking at the tweet itself: it's using hashtags for Venezuela, Israel, and America, saying they're "gone," and then stating that the world is in peace. The word "gone" could imply that these countries are no longer involved or present, which might suggest a resolution to some extent. But given the context of the crisis, I'm not sure if this is positive or negative.

The author seems to be making a statement about the situation changing—maybe implying that without these countries' involvement, peace can prevail. However, considering the ongoing conflict in Venezuela, it's unclear whether the author views this as a positive outcome or just stating a fact.

I need to map this emotion using the given labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The guidelines mention secondary emotions that fall under each category. So, if the tweet conveys something like hope or optimism, it might be classified under joy. Alternatively, if it's expressing relief, that could also lean towards joy.

But wait, is there any indication of emotion in the tweet itself? It seems more declarative than emotional. The author isn't explicitly showing happiness, anger, etc., but perhaps the implication is positive—suggesting peace after some turmoil. So maybe the emotion here is joy because they're indicating that things have calmed down.

Alternatively, could it be surprise? If the world being at peace without these countries' involvement is unexpected, then surprise might fit. But I think the primary emotion is more about hope or positivity, which aligns with joy.
