Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet is about World Book Day, which is a positive event promoting reading. The author is encouraging others to share their favorite books on film or TV, especially those by women. They're using emojis like stars and a book emoji, which are cheerful. The tone seems enthusiastic and inviting, trying to engage people in a conversation around books. There's no negative language here; instead, it's all about celebration and sharing knowledge. So the emotion conveyed is definitely positive. Looking at the options, joy fits because they're expressing happiness and excitement.
