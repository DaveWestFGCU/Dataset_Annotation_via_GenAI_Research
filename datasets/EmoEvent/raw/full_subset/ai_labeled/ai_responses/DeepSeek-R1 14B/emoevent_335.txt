Okay, I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The user wrote, "If #Socialism is so good why does it fail every time? #Venezuela." 

First, looking at the content, they're questioning the effectiveness of socialism by pointing out its repeated failures. This suggests a critical perspective towards socialism, likely referring to Venezuela's situation given the context provided.

The emotion here isn't explicitly stated, but I can infer the sentiment. The user is expressing frustration or disappointment with socialist policies in Venezuela. They might be annoyed or upset about the ongoing issues, which points towards anger. 

I don't see any signs of disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. It's more about criticism and frustration, so anger fits best.
