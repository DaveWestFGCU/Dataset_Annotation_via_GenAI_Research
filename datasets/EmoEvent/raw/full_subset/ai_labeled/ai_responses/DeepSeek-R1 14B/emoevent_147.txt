Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The user wrote, "I don't have any doubt that we will achieve democracy." They're talking about Venezuela's situation, which is a crisis with conflicting claims over who the legitimate president is.

The context mentions that there's been a lot of division and tension since January 2019 between supporters of Maduro and Guaido. So, the user is expressing confidence in achieving democracy despite this turmoil.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet doesn't show any negative emotions like anger or fear. Instead, it's positive because they're hopeful about democracy. 

The guidelines say that if the emotion is similar to serenity or ecstasy, classify as joy. Here, the user seems optimistic and confident, which aligns with joy rather than other options like surprise or sadness.

So, I think the primary emotion here is joy.

joy
