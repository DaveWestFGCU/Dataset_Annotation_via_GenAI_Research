Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. The tweet says: "Absolutely ridiculous statement. Bolton is trying to create rifts in the chavista camp, but chose the worst characters for his soap opera. #VenezuelaCoup #venezuela #juanguaido #nicolasmaduro https://t.co/vznihdhDIW"

First, I'll break down the content. The author is clearly reacting to a statement made by Bolton. They describe it as "absolutely ridiculous," which immediately makes me think of negative emotions like anger or disgust.

Looking at the second sentence: "Bolton is trying to create rifts in the chavista camp, but chose the worst characters for his soap opera." The use of words like "ridiculous" and "soap opera" suggests a sense of mockery or disdain. This could point towards either anger or disgust.

The hashtags used are #VenezuelaCoup, which indicates they're following the political developments closely. The mention of Juan Guaido and Nicolas Maduro shows that the tweet is about the ongoing crisis in Venezuela regarding who is the legitimate president.

Now, considering the emotion mapping guidelines: if it's similar to annoyance or rage, it's anger. If it's disinterest or dislike, it's disgust. Here, the author seems more frustrated with Bolton's actions rather than just expressing a neutral stance. The term "ridiculous" and the sarcastic tone suggest a stronger negative emotion.

I think "absolutely ridiculous" is a strong indicator of frustration or anger. They're not just disagreeing but are clearly upset about the statement made by Bolton. So, this leans more towards anger rather than disgust because it's directed at someone's actions that they find unacceptable.

Therefore, the primary emotion here is likely anger.
