Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The tweet says "Happy #WorldBookDayðŸ“š! We've got a great list of staff recommended #animation books to add to your shelves ðŸ‘‰https://t.co/VQtF5VrgAp Happy reading! ðŸ˜‰ https://t.co/z7H9Jdbqb5". 

First, I notice the word "Happy" right at the beginning. That's a strong indicator of joy. The use of emojis like the book and smiley face also supports that feeling. They're promoting books and sharing a list, which seems positive and exciting.

Looking at the context provided, World Book Day is about celebrating reading and books, so it's naturally associated with happiness and enthusiasm. The tweet is encouraging others to read more by offering recommendations, which is a cheerful gesture.

I don't see any negative words or emotions here. Everything points towards positivity and excitement. So, considering the guidelines, joy seems like the correct classification because it's about serenity or ecstasy, but in this case, it's more of enthusiasm and happiness.
