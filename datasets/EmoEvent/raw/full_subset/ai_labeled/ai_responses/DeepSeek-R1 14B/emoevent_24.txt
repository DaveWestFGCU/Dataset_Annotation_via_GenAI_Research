Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says, "Anyway, happy #WorldBookDay and protect our libraries...." followed by a link.

First, let's break down the content. The author is mentioning World Book Day, which is a positive event promoting reading and books. They're using the word "happy," which immediately suggests joy or a positive emotion. Additionally, they're encouraging people to protect libraries, which is another positive action aimed at preserving resources for others.

Looking at the context provided, World Book Day is organized by UNESCO to promote reading, so it's inherently a celebratory event. The use of "happy" directly indicates a feeling of joy. There are no negative words or sentiments expressed here; everything seems uplifting and supportive.

Considering the mapping guidelines, joy is associated with emotions like serenity or ecstasy. While "happy" isn't exactly ecstasy, it definitely falls under the umbrella of positive emotions that align with joy. The author's message is encouraging and cheerful, which reinforces the idea that they're expressing joy.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise in this tweet. It's all about celebrating books and libraries, so the emotion here is clearly joy.
