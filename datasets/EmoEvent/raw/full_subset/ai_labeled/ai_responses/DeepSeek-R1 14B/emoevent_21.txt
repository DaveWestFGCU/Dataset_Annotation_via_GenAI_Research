Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about World Book Day. Let me start by reading the tweet carefully.

The tweet says: "Happy #WorldBookDay! #DidYouKnow that over 1 million books have been borrowed from #QNL in the past year? We challenge you to read a book every month! Which books do you plan on adding to your list? Special thanks to USER for the awesome images! https://t.co/HTZtJiryGI"

First, I notice the tweet starts with "Happy #WorldBookDay!" which immediately signals a positive tone. The author is celebrating World Book Day, so that's a good indicator of joy or happiness.

Next, they mention that over 1 million books have been borrowed from QNL (probably Qatar National Library). That's a significant number and seems like something to celebrate. They're highlighting the success of the library, which adds to the positive vibe.

Then, there's a challenge: "We challenge you to read a book every month!" This is encouraging and motivational, again pointing towards a positive emotion. The author is trying to engage others in reading, which is an uplifting message.

They also ask, "Which books do you plan on adding to your list?" This question invites interaction and shows interest in what others are reading, which is another friendly and joyful aspect.

Finally, they thank someone for the images, calling them "awesome." That's a compliment and adds to the positive tone of the tweet.

Looking at the context provided, World Book Day is about promoting reading, which aligns with the author's message. The use of emojis like the book emoji in the hashtag also supports the celebratory mood.

Now, considering the mapping guidelines: joy is associated with emotions like serenity or ecstasy. While this tweet isn't ecstatic, it's definitely positive and encouraging, fitting under joy.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise here. The overall message is upbeat and aimed at spreading happiness related to reading.
