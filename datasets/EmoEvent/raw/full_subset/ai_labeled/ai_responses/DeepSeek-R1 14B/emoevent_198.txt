Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says: "Honestly the real sorcery here is how Melisandre really didn't age at all in 8 years... #GOT #GameofThrones". 

First, let's break down what the tweet is saying. The user is pointing out that Melisandre, a character known for her powers, hasn't aged despite eight years passing in the series. They're using "sorcery" as a reference to her magical abilities but twist it to highlight her lack of aging.

Now, considering the emotion mapping guidelines: anger is about annoyance or rage, disgust is disinterest or dislike, fear is apprehension or anxiety, joy is serenity or ecstasy, sadness is pensiveness or grief, and surprise is distraction or amazement.

The tweet seems to be pointing out something interesting or surprising. The user is highlighting a detail that might not have been obvious to everyone elseâ€”the fact that Melisandre hasn't aged. This could be seen as a clever observation or a twist on the usual narrative, which makes it stand out. 

So, the emotion here isn't anger because there's no frustration expressed. It's not disgust either; the user isn't showing dislike. There's no fear or sadness in the tweet. The tone seems more light-hearted and intrigued. Therefore, the primary emotion is surprise because they're pointing out something unexpected or amazing about the character.
