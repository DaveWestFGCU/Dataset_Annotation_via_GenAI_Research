Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet and classify it using one of the given labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me start by reading the tweet carefully.

The tweet says: "How can we utilise neuroscience to increase youth participation in campaignsðŸ§ ? Brilliant article by our own USER, looking into the science behind what's driving the socially conscious youths of today." It also includes some hashtags related to social change and mentions Greta Thunberg and David Hogg.

First, I notice that the author is asking a question about using neuroscience to boost youth participation. The mention of "brilliant article" suggests approval or praise. They're highlighting an article by someone in their network, which indicates they find it valuable or insightful.

The tone seems positive because they're commending the article and showing interest in how neuroscience can help their cause. Words like "utilise," "increase," "brilliant," and "science behind" all point towards a constructive and optimistic perspective.

Looking at the context provided, Greta Thunberg is known for her activism on climate change, so this tweet seems related to that movement. The author is likely part of an activist group trying to engage more young people, hence their interest in neuroscience applications.

Considering the emotion labels: anger would imply frustration or rage, which doesn't fit here. Disgust relates to dislike, but there's no negative sentiment. Fear isn't present either; the tone is proactive. Sadness and surprise also don't align with the positive and encouraging vibe.

Joy seems appropriate because the author is expressing enthusiasm about an article that could help their cause. They're excited or happy about the potential impact of neuroscience on youth participation, which ties into their activism goals.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion here is joy.
