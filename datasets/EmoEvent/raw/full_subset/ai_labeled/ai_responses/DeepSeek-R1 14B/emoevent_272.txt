Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet by Greta Thunberg. Let me read it again: "Simple question: Is it the end of #opera, when artists cannot fly anymore? Sad, would love to see you perform around the world USER. USER #GretaThunberg https://t.co/zrgSCQk6WG"

Hmm, she's talking about opera and whether it ends if artists can't fly anymore. That part is a bit confusingâ€”maybe she's using "fly" metaphorically? Then she says she's sad and would love to see the user perform around the world.

So breaking this down: The tweet starts with a question about opera, which might be a metaphor for something else, but then she explicitly states she's sad. She expresses a desire to see someone perform, which shows her disappointment or sadness that it might not happen.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet clearly mentions "Sad," so that points directly to sadness. There's no indication of other emotions like anger or fear; it's a straightforward expression of sorrow over the situation she's describing.
