Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Fletcher and the Champions League. The user is asking me to classify it into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, let's read the tweet carefully: "Will Fletcher ever run out of facts? It's like having the pub bore on commentary. #ChampionsLeague." 

The mention of Fletcher suggests they're talking about someone named Fletcher who is perhaps a commentator. The phrase "run out of facts" implies that Fletcher is known for providing a lot of information during commentaries. Then, the tweet compares him to "the pub bore," which I think refers to someone who dominates conversations in a pub, always talking and not letting others speak—so maybe someone who's boring or tedious.

So, the author is expressing frustration with Fletcher's commentary style. They're annoyed because he doesn't stop talking and provides too many facts, making it like listening to a bore at the pub. The emotion here seems to be frustration or irritation, which falls under the category of anger as per the guidelines. 

I don't think it's disgust because that would involve dislike for something恶心的 (disgusting), but rather frustration with someone's behavior. Fear isn't present; there's no indication of anxiety or terror. Joy and surprise are clearly not applicable here since the tone is negative. Sadness might be if they were feeling down, but again, it's more about irritation.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed is anger.
