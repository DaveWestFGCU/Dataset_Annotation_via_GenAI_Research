Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The tweet says, "#NotreDameCathedralFire 'Like a bombing': Daylight reveals extent of Notre-Dame damage https://t.co/XaoHhS0WWf". 

First, let's break down the content. The hashtag is clearly indicating the event, which is the fire at Notre Dame. The tweet includes a quote: "'Like a bombing'", which suggests that the speaker is comparing the destruction to something as severe as a bombing. That comparison implies a strong negative reaction.

The phrase "Daylight reveals extent of Notre-Dame damage" indicates that when it became light, people could see how bad the damage was. This might evoke feelings of shock or surprise because seeing the full impact after darkness could be unexpected and devastating.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: if the tweet conveys a secondary emotion similar to distraction or amazement, classify it as surprise. The use of "like a bombing" is quite intense and shocking, which can lead someone to feel surprised by the extent of the damage. It's not necessarily fear because there's no indication of personal danger, nor is it sadness in this contextâ€”it's more about the reaction to the news rather than mourning.

So, considering all that, I think the primary emotion here is surprise.
