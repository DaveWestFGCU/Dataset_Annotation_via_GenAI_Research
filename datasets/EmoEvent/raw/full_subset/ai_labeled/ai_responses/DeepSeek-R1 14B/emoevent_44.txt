Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The user is talking about books being fantastic therapy and how they helped them through bereavement and cancer. They also mention being happy for World Book Day.

First, let's break down the content. Bereavement and cancer are serious, difficult experiences, so using books as therapy suggests that the person found comfort or support in reading. The mention of "make it through" indicates resilience and positive coping mechanisms.

The tweet ends with "Happy #WorldBookDay," which is clearly an expression of joy. They're celebrating the day and sharing their positive experience with books. There's no negative language here; instead, everything points towards a positive emotion.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: Joy includes emotions like serenity or ecstasy. While the user isn't expressing extreme joy, their message is uplifting and shares a positive sentiment about how books have helped them. The use of "Happy" directly aligns with joy.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise in the tweet. It's all about sharing a positive experience and promoting something they care aboutâ€”books as therapy tools. So, the emotion here is definitely joy.
