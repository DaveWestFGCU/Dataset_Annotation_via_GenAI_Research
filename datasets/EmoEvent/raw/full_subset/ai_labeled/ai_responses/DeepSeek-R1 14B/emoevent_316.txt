Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Barcelona winning a football league. Let me start by reading the tweet carefully.

The tweet says: "We are #champion again. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 We have the USER Cup once again. USER are CHAMPIONS 2018-2019! 8 leagues in 11 years. Final score 1-0 USER scores in the 62nd minute. #barcelona #laliga https://t.co/88Aw8q69BC"

First, I notice a lot of emojis with clapping hands 👏 repeated multiple times. That usually signifies excitement or joy. The words "champion" and "CHAMPIONS" are in all caps, which emphasizes celebration. They mention winning the Cup again, being champions for that season, and highlight their success over 11 years with 8 league titles. These are all positive achievements.

The tweet also includes specific details about the final score and when they scored, showing pride in the victory. The use of hashtags like #barcelona and #laliga indicates a sense of community and pride among fans.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: joy is associated with emotions like serenity or ecstasy. While this isn't serene, the excitement and celebration definitely fit under joy. There's no sign of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise here—just pure happiness about their success.
