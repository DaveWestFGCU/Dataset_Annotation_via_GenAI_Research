Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet by Greta Thunberg or someone related to her movement. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet starts with "USER USER USER USER" which seems like a repetition, maybe trying to get attention or signal something. Then they say, "It's always been a meh kind of issue." That "meh" suggests that the person feels indifferent or not very interested before. 

Next part: "With more youth getting involved maybe it's finally getting attn." So they're saying that because more young people are joining in, the issue is now getting attention. The word "attn" probably stands for attention. They seem hopeful here.

Then, "Depends who they asked, of course!" This might be a bit sarcastic or cautious, implying that it depends on whom you ask, so maybe not everyone agrees or is paying attention.

But then the tweet says, "But I was happy to see it, because climate usually never makes the list." So here, the person expresses happiness. They're glad that climate change is getting some attention now, which is unusual for them.

The hashtags used are #buzzbuzz üêù, which sounds like excitement or buzz around something, and others related to Greta Thunberg and Fridays for Future. The emojis might add a playful or enthusiastic tone.

Putting it all together: Initially, there's a sense of indifference ("meh"), but then shifts to hope and happiness because more youth involvement is bringing attention to climate issues. The overall sentiment seems positive, expressing joy at the situation improving.
