Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. The user wrote, "I didn't notice your live coverage from the failed socialist state of #Venezuela. Too real for your failed narrative?" 

First, let me break down the words and tone here. They mention a "failed socialist state," which sounds critical. Using "failed" twice emphasizes their frustration with the situation in Venezuela. The hashtags like #Venezuela might indicate they're talking about current events or a specific issue.

The phrase "Too real for your failed narrative?" suggests that the user is dismissing someone else's perspective as not capturing reality accurately, possibly because it's biased or incorrect. This could imply sarcasm or mockery towards the other person's viewpoint.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: anger includes annoyance and rage. The tone here seems sarcastic and critical, which can be signs of frustration or irritation. There's no indication of fear, joy, sadness, disgust (like dislike), or surprise. It's more about expressing dissatisfaction with how the situation is being portrayed.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed is likely anger because of the critical and sarcastic tone towards the narrative.
