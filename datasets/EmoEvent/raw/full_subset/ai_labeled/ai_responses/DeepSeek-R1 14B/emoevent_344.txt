Record: "The Notre Dame Cathedral will be a well-funded restoration, but hereâ€™s some historically black churches destroyed by hate-motivated arson that could really benefit from our donations!  https://t.co/87jAKyWS2w #NotreDameCathedralFire #churchfire"

Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is comparing it to historically black churches destroyed by hate-motivated arson and suggesting donations for those instead. They're pointing out a contrast where a well-funded restoration is happening for Notre Dame, but other churches are neglected.

Hmm, the tone here seems critical or upset. They might be frustrated that more attention isn't being given to these other incidents. So, maybe they're feeling anger because of the disparity and the underlying issue of racism and hate crimes not getting enough support.
