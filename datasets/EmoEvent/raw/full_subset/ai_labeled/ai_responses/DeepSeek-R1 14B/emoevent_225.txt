Alright, let's tackle this tweet classification task. The user provided a specific instruction to identify the primary emotion from a list of six options: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. They also included detailed mapping guidelines for each emotion.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully: "Suarez is one horrible fucker isn't he. #ChampionsLeague #BARLIV". The mention of Suarez and calling him a "horrible fucker" clearly indicates strong negative emotions. 

Looking at the context, Suarez is known in football for various incidents, often leading to controversy. The use of explicit language like "fuck" suggests intense dislike or anger.

Now, applying the mapping guidelines: if the emotion is similar to annoyance or rage, it's anger. If it's more about disinterest or loathing, it's disgust. Here, the tweet expresses strong dislike and anger towards Suarez. 

I need to decide whether this falls under anger or disgust. The term "horrible fucker" leans more towards expressing anger rather than mere disgust. It's a direct insult with a tone of frustration.

Therefore, the primary emotion here is anger.
