Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let's read it carefully.

The tweet says, "We are the champions🏆🔥 Messi scores the winner 👽 🐐 #LaLiga 26 #BarçaLevante #forçabarça." 

First, the use of emojis like the trophy 🏆 and fire 🔥 suggests excitement or celebration. The mention of being champions is definitely a positive achievement. Also, Messi scoring the winning goal is highlighted with emojis that seem to emphasize his greatness (maybe the alien 👽 and goat 🐐 are symbols of him being the best, like "GOAT" which stands for Greatest Of All Time). 

The hashtags also support this: #LaLiga, #BarçaLevante, and #forçabarça all relate to football, specifically supporting Barcelona. The overall tone is one of triumph and happiness.

Looking at the emotion categories, joy seems to fit best here because it's about celebrating a victory and expressing pride. There's no sign of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise—just pure excitement and happiness.
