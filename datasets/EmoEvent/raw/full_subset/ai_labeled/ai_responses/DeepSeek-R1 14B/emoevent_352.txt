Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The tweet says: "HAPPY #WORLDBOOKDAY FROM YOUR FAVORITE NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLING BOOK TWITTER!!!! and shoutout to our dads USER &amp; USER_Manuel!! we love you guys!! go read! https://t.co/p0psoXCsvF"

First, I notice the word "HAPPY" at the beginning. That's a strong indicator of joy. The use of all caps emphasizes excitement. They're celebrating World Book Day, which is about promoting reading and booksâ€”something positive.

Next, they mention their dads with affection: "we love you guys!!" This shows affection and happiness towards their dads. Encouraging others to read also conveys a sense of enthusiasm and positivity.

The emojis used (though not visible here) would likely be cheerful ones, given the context of celebrating books and happiness. The link probably leads to more content related to reading or promotions, which adds to the celebratory tone.

Looking at the guidelines, joy is associated with emotions like serenity or ecstasy. While this tweet isn't serene, it's definitely ecstatic and full of excitement. There's no sign of any negative emotions like anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise. The overall message is upbeat and encouraging.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion here is joy.
