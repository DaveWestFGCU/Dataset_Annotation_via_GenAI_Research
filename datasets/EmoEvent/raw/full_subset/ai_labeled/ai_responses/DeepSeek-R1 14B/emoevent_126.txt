Record: "I'm generally really against spoilers - I can't hear a tiny detail without my brain immediately extrapolating everything around it - but still, the race to catch up on stuff before someone well-meaning 'thinks' they're not spoiling something is REALLY STRESSFUL... #GameofThrones"

Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user says they're generally against spoilers because hearing even a tiny detail makes their brain immediately think of everything else. They find it really stressful trying to catch up before someone might accidentally spoil something. 

Hmm, the key words here are "stressful" and "REALLY STRESSFUL." Stress usually relates to fear or anxiety. The person is worried about being spoiled, which creates a sense of apprehension or dread. So I think this falls under fear because they're feeling anxious about not wanting spoilers but struggling to avoid them.
