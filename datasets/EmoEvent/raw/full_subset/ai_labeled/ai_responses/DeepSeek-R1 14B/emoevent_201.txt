Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says, "The perfect postcard for #WorldBookDay and #ShakespeareDay ðŸ˜Š" with a smiley face. World Book Day is about promoting reading, which is positive. The user is sharing a postcard, probably happy about it. The smiley emoji definitely shows joy. There's no negative words or signs of other emotions like anger or fear. So the emotion here is clearly joy.
