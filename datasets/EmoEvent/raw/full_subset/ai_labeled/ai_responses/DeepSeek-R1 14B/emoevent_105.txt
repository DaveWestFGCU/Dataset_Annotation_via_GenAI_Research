Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet says: "A monument to human creation/achievement has been lost. That it's been used as a house of worship is irrelevant. That some in our community are behaving as reactionary tribalists shouldn't guide our response. Condolences. #NotreDame #NotreDameCathedralFire #NotreDameCathedral https://t.co/ZyrlwFNXOR"

First, the author mentions that a monument to human achievement has been lost. That sounds like they're expressing sadness or grief about the loss. They also say it's irrelevant that it was a house of worship, which might indicate they don't want to focus on religious aspects but rather the cultural loss.

Then, they criticize some people in the community for behaving as reactionary tribalists and suggest that this shouldn't guide the response. This part shows frustration or disappointment with others' reactions, possibly leaning towards anger or disgust.

Finally, they end with "condolences," which is a clear expression of sympathy and sadness.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

The primary emotions here seem to be sadness because of the loss and expressing condolences. The frustration part might add some secondary emotion like anger or disgust, but the main feeling conveyed is sadness.
