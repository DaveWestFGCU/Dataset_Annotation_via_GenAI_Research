Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The tweet says, "Wow, speechless to see the Cross still standing." Let me break this down.

First, the user starts with "Wow," which is an exclamation that often expresses surprise or amazement. Then they mention being "speechless," which can indicate shock or astonishment. The main point of their tweet is focusing on the cross still standing amidst the fire, which is a significant and symbolic structure. 

Considering the context of the Notre Dame fire, it's a tragic event, but the tweet isn't expressing sadness directly. Instead, the emphasis is on something positive survivingâ€”maybe even a sense of hope or resilience. The use of "Wow" and "speechless" suggests that the author is taken aback by this particular detail amidst the disaster.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: surprise includes reactions like distraction or amazement. Here, the user seems amazed that the cross is still standing, which fits under surprise rather than sadness or fear. There's no indication of anger, disgust, or joy here; it's more about being struck by an unexpected sight in a tragic event.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion is surprise because of the astonishment expressed regarding the cross remaining standing.
