Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion of this tweet about Venezuela's crisis. The user is talking about how Venezuela won't collapse and refers to imperialism and colonialism by the USA, mentioning several countries where the US has had involvement. 

First, let me break down the content. The user seems to be expressing strong opposition against what they perceive as American interference in Venezuela. They're using hashtags like #Imperialism, #Colonialism, and naming specific US military and financial complexes. This suggests a critical view of US foreign policy.

The tone here is quite intense. Words like "dying" and "last lost war" indicate frustration or anger towards the policies being discussed. The user isn't just stating facts; they're clearly taking a stand against what's happening, which points to an emotional response rather than a neutral observation.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger is about annoyance or rage, disgust is more about dislike, fear is apprehension, joy is positive feelings, sadness is pensiveness, and surprise is about amazement. The user isn't expressing any positive emotions here; instead, they're showing strong disapproval.

The mention of multiple countries affected by US actions (Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia) adds to the critique, suggesting a broader frustration with US foreign policy. This frustration aligns more with anger rather than disgust because it's directed at an external force and expresses irritation or rage.

I don't see any elements pointing towards fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The emotion here is clearly one of strong opposition and frustration, which fits under anger.
