Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user is talking about an hour and a half of TV that was really good. They mention suspense, action, horror, devastation, and delight. Those words all sound like strong emotions. 

Suspense usually makes you feel tense or on edge, which can be related to fear or anxiety. Action might make it exciting, contributing to joy or surprise. Horror would definitely bring in fear elements. Devastation is a negative emotion, probably sadness or anger. Delight is clearly positive, associated with joy.

Looking at the list of emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet has both positive and negative elements. But the overall tone seems enthusiastic and praising. Words like "best" and "witnessed" show excitement. The use of exclamation marks also indicates a strong positive feeling.

So even though there are mentions of devastation and horror (which could lean towards fear or sadness), the dominant emotion is joy because the user is expressing how great the TV time was, using words like "suspense," "action," and "delight." They seem to be enjoying it a lot, so I think the primary emotion here is joy.
