Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says, "Messi is the fuckin GOAT #ChampionsLeague #UCL." Let me break it down.

First, "GOAT" stands for Greatest Of All Time, which is a strong compliment. The word "fuckin" adds emphasis and intensity to that statement. So the author is expressing high praise for Messi. 

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to pick one.

The tweet doesn't show any negative emotions like anger or disgust. It's not about fear or sadness either. There's no element of surprise here; it's more of a strong positive sentiment. So that leaves joy as the primary emotion because they're expressing admiration and excitement about Messi being the GOAT in the Champions League context.

I think the emotion is joy.
