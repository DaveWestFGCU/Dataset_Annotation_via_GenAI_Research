Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet is: "Come on really tho THAT FREE KICK!!!!!! üêê talk #Messi #ChampionsLeague". 

First, let's break down the components of the tweet. The user starts with "Come on really tho", which sounds like they're expressing disbelief or surprise. Then they exclaim "THAT FREE KICK!!!!!!" in all caps, which emphasizes their strong reaction. The use of multiple exclamation marks indicates high emotion.

The emoji used is üêê, which I think stands for "üêê talk". Wait, no, actually, the goat emoji can sometimes be used as a reference to "GOAT", meaning Greatest Of All Time. So maybe they're saying something about Messi being the GOAT because of that free kick. Alternatively, it could be a typo or slang I'm not familiar with.

Looking at the hashtags: #Messi and #ChampionsLeague. This suggests the tweet is related to a football match involving Messi in the Champions League. The mention of a "free kick" likely refers to a specific moment in the game where Messi took a free kick, probably resulting in a goal or an impressive play.

Putting it all together: The user seems to be reacting to a recent event‚Äîa free kick by Messi. Their use of exclamation marks and the emoji suggests they're amazed or surprised by what happened. They might be expressing shock at how incredible the moment was, possibly because it was unexpected or exceptionally skillful.

Now, considering the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The user's reaction doesn't seem to fit into anger (no signs of frustration), disgust (nothing negative about the action), fear (no indication of worry), or sadness (no sorrow expressed). Joy is possible if they're happy about Messi's skill, but the emphasis seems more on astonishment rather than pure happiness.

Surprise fits well here because the user is reacting with disbelief and amazement to an unexpected or impressive event. The use of exclamation marks and the emoji both support this interpretation.
