Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says: "Despite it being in the midst of all the fighting and death, this scene was truly beautiful." Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the context is that Game of Thrones is a popular fantasy drama series, and the last season came out in April 2019. The tweet mentions fighting and death, which are common elements in the show, but then says the scene was "truly beautiful." 

The author is contrasting the violent aspects ("fighting and death") with finding beauty in it. So, they're expressing that even amidst all the chaos and conflict, there's something positive or aesthetically pleasing. The word "beautiful" stands out here as a strong indicator of emotion.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: joy includes emotions like serenity or ecstasy. While "beautiful" might not be exactly those words, it does convey a sense of positive feeling, which aligns with joy. There's no indication of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise in the tweet. The focus is on appreciating something despite its violent context.

So, I think the primary emotion here is joy because they're finding beauty and positivity in a scene that's otherwise intense.
