Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet regarding Venezuela's political crisis. The user is talking about whether someone is legitimate or not and mentions regime change wars and the aftermath if one were to happen. They also say there's no benefit to Venezuela.

Hmm, looking at the words used: " USER USER Shes not & youd know that..." seems a bit frustrated or annoyed. Then they mention being into regime change wars or giving a shit about the aftermath. The use of "gave a shit" adds some intensity, which might indicate anger or frustration.

The overall tone doesn't seem positive; it's more critical and dismissive. They're questioning others' motivations and expressing that there's no benefit, which could be a sign of underlying anger towards those involved in the crisis.

I don't see any signs of joy, fear, surprise, disgust, or sadness dominating here. The main emotion seems to be frustration or annoyance, which according to the guidelines falls under anger.
