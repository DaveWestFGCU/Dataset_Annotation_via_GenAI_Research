Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user wrote, "My god the latest USER episode was literally everything! I think that is the best thing I’ve seen on TV ever!!! 😱😁😱😁 #GameofThrones". 

First, looking at the words used: "best thing", "ever", and multiple emojis like 😱 and 😁. The exclamation marks show excitement. The emojis are a mix of surprise faces and grinning ones. So, the user is expressing strong positive feelings.

The primary emotion here seems to be joy because they're praising the episode highly and using happy emojis. But wait, there's also some surprise indicated by the 😱 emojis. However, the main sentiment is excitement and happiness, which points more towards joy than surprise.

I should consider if any other emotions might fit better. There's no anger or disgust; it's all positive. Fear isn't present either. Sadness? No, they're clearly happy. So, between joy and surprise. The emojis include both surprise and grinning, but the overall message is about how great the episode was, which leans more towards joy.

Therefore, I think the emotion here is joy.
