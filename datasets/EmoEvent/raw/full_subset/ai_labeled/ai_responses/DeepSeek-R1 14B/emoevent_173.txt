Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says, "I’m surprised #AOC isn’t pushing for intervention in #Venezuela it can’t be good for her agenda." 

First, let's break down the words and context. The user mentions being "surprised" that AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) isn't pushing for intervention in Venezuela. They also note that this might not be good for her agenda.

The emotion here is explicitly stated as surprise because the tweet starts with "I’m surprised." That immediately points towards surprise. The user is expressing astonishment or unexpectedness regarding AOC's stance on the issue.

Looking at the mapping guidelines, surprise includes secondary emotions like distraction or amazement. Since the tweet directly uses "surprised," it fits under the surprise category without any ambiguity.

I don't see any other primary emotion here. There's no indication of anger, disgust, fear, joy, or sadness. The focus is solely on the unexpectedness of AOC's inaction regarding Venezuela.
