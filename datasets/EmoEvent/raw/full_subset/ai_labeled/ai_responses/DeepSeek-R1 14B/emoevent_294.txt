Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about World Book Day. The tweet is sharing some beautiful libraries and using a couple of hashtags related to travel. Let me break it down.

First, the context given is that World Book Day is an event by UNESCO promoting reading, which is positive. The tweet itself mentions "the world's most beautiful libraries," which sounds like something someone would find aesthetically pleasing or inspiring. The use of words like "beautiful" suggests admiration or appreciation.

Looking at the hashtags, #WorldBookDay indicates it's part of a celebration or awareness campaign, and #CNTraveler likely targets travelers interested in cultural spots. The author is sharing this information, probably to inspire others or spread joy about libraries and reading.

Now, considering the emotion mapping guidelines: if the tweet conveys serenity or ecstasy, it's joy. Here, "beautiful" and the context of celebrating books and libraries seem to evoke positive feelings. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or sadness. The tone is uplifting and shares something nice, which aligns with joy.

I don't see any elements pointing towards surprise because there's nothing unexpected hereâ€”it's a typical promotional tweet for a celebrated event. Fear, disgust, or surprise aren't present. Sadness or pensiveness also don't fit; the message is clearly positive.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion is joy.
