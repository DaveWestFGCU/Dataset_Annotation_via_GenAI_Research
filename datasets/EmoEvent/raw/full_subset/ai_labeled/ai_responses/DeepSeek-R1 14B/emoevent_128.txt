Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The tweet says, "I want to visit this beautiful museum ðŸ˜¢ it was museum not just another church #NotreDameCathedralFire." 

First, looking at the content, the user expresses a desire to visit a museum, which is Notre-Dame Cathedral in this case. They mention that it's a museum and not just another church, indicating they see it as more than a religious siteâ€”it has cultural or historical significance for them.

The emoji used here is ðŸ˜¢, which typically represents sadness or crying. So the emotion expressed through the emoji is sadness. The tweet also reflects a sense of loss because the cathedral was destroyed by fire, so the user might be feeling sad about that event preventing them from visiting as they hoped.

Additionally, the hashtags like #NotreDameCathedralFire suggest awareness and concern about the event, which aligns with feelings of sorrow or grief. The overall message seems to focus on the loss of an important place, hence sadness is the primary emotion here.
