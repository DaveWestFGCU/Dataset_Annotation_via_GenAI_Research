Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The tweet says, "#WorldBookDay We all have special corner at home, where we relish reading. '#RT’ if you agree! https://t.co/0erA1YOBZt". 

First, let's break down the content. It's talking about having a special place at home for reading, which sounds positive. The word "relish" means to take great pleasure in something, so that's a clue towards a positive emotion.

The tweet is encouraging others to retweet if they agree, which suggests a sense of community and shared enjoyment. There's no negative language here; instead, it's all about celebrating reading and books.

Looking at the context provided, World Book Day is meant to promote reading and culture, so the tone aligns with that mission. The use of emojis or exclamation marks isn't present, but the choice of words like "special corner" and "relish" definitely convey a positive feeling.

Considering the mapping guidelines, joy is associated with emotions like serenity or ecstasy. While this tweet isn't overly enthusiastic, it does express a pleasant and happy sentiment about reading. There's no indication of any other emotion like anger, fear, or surprise.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion here seems to be joy because it's celebrating something enjoyable and positive.
