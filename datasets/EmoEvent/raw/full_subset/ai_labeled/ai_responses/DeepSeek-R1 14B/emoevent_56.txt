Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Spanish election. The tweet says, "Far right in a country that still hosts this pervert Franco memorial? Cannot be. #SpainElection." 

First, let's break down the content. The user is talking about the far right being involved in Spain's politics, specifically mentioning Franco's memorial. Franco was a dictator in Spain, so referring to him as a "pervert" shows strong negative feelings towards him and his legacy.

The phrase "Cannot be" at the end seems like the author is expressing disbelief or shock that such a situation could occur. They're probably surprised that the far right would align with something related to Franco, who is widely seen negatively in Spain.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: surprise includes secondary emotions like distraction or amazement. The tweet's tone suggests the author finds it astonishing or unexpected that the far right is associated with Franco's memorial. There's no indication of anger, disgust, fear, joy, or sadness here; it's more about the astonishment.

So, considering all this, the emotion conveyed is surprise.
