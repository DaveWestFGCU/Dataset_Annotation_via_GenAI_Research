Okay, let's try to figure out the emotion behind this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is talking about multi-billionaires and the Catholic Church saving funds for victims of sex abuse. They're clearly upset about the situation, maybe even angry because they feel the priorities are misplaced. The mention of "Psst! Am I being too real again?" suggests sarcasm or frustration. So, the primary emotion here seems to be anger.
