Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about World Book Day. Let me read it again: "Happy #WorldBookDay ðŸ“–ðŸ“– to you readers & Bookworms. Keep on navigating like a voyager who is in search of proposition & contentment in life. May your indomitable learning zeal excel in a right way. Keep on absorbing comprehension at the speed of light."

Hmm, the tweet starts with "Happy," which immediately makes me think of joy or happiness. The use of emojis with books reinforces that positive feeling. The author is encouraging readers to keep reading and seeking contentment, which sounds uplifting.

Looking at the language used: words like "happy," "navigate," "voyager," "search," "proposition," "contentment," "indomitable learning zeal," "excel," "absorbing comprehension." All these terms have a positive connotation. The author is celebrating reading and encouraging others to continue their journey of learning.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, or surprise here. It's all about promoting joy through reading. So the primary emotion here should be joy.
