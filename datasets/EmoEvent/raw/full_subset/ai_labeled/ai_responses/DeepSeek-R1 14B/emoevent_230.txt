Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The tweet says, "Such sad things are happening in the world rn ðŸ˜”" with some hashtags related to the event.

First, looking at the words used: "sad things," which directly mentions sadness. The emoji used is a face with a frown and maybe tears, which reinforces the feeling of sadness. The person is expressing that they're upset about what's happening in the world right now, specifically referencing the Notre Dame fire.

I should consider if there's any other emotion present. There's no indication of anger or frustration; it's more about the situation being unfortunate. Disgust doesn't seem to fit because it's not about dislike but rather sorrow. Fear isn't indicated eitherâ€”no mention of worry or anxiety. Joy and surprise are clearly not applicable here since the tweet is expressing negative feelings.

So, the primary emotion here is sadness. The author is conveying a sense of grief or unhappiness about the events occurring.
