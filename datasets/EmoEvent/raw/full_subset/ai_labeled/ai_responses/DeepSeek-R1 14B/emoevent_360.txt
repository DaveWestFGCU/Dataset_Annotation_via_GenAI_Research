Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Greta Thunberg. Let me read it again: "Such an inspiration #GretaThunberg , she will be remembered in history as a great example to follow, now it’s up to the rest of us if we want to be with her, on the right side of history #ClimateActionNow #ClimateCrisis #FridaysForFuture https://t.co/GaDCpm2vBG"

Hmm, the tweet starts by calling Greta Thunberg an inspiration. That's a positive term. Then it says she'll be remembered as a great example, which is also praise. The author mentions that it's up to others whether they join her, but the tone seems encouraging and hopeful.

The hashtags used are #ClimateActionNow, #ClimateCrisis, and #FridaysForFuture, all of which relate to environmental activism and support for Greta's movement. These reinforce a positive sentiment.

I don't see any negative words or emotions here. The focus is on admiration, respect, and encouragement. So the emotion conveyed is definitely a positive one. Looking at the options, joy seems appropriate because it's about inspiration and hope.
