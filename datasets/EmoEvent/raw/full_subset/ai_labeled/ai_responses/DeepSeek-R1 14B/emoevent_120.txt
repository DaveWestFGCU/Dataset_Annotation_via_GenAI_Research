Record: "Very disappointed Salah failed to net that. You just have to score or at least hit the target. What more can you say about Messi. Ridiculous man. Ridiculous career. #BARLIV #ChampionsLeague"

Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion behind it. The user is talking about Salah failing to net a goal and expresses disappointment. They mention that he should have scored or at least hit the target, which shows they're upset about his performance. Then they talk about Messi in a negative way, calling him "ridiculous," which adds to the frustration.

The hashtags used are #BARLIV and #ChampionsLeague, indicating it's related to football, specifically the Champions League. The overall tone is one of dissatisfaction and frustration with the players' performance. There's no positive language here; instead, words like "disappointed" and "ridiculous" clearly convey negative emotions.

Looking at the mapping guidelines, disappointment falls under sadness because it involves pensiveness or grief. While there's some frustration, which could lean towards anger, the primary emotion expressed is more about being let down rather than rage. So, I think sadness is the most fitting label here.
