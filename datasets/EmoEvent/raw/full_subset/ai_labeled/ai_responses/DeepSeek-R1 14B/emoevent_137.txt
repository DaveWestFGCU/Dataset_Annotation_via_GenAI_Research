Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says, "Thank you for your $5 million donation to rebuild #NotreDameCathedralFire." 

First, let's understand the context. The Notre Dame Cathedral fire happened on April 15, 2019, which was a significant event that caused a lot of damage and emotional response globally. People were devastated because it's such an iconic and culturally important building.

Now, looking at the tweet itself: the user is thanking someone for a $5 million donation to rebuild the cathedral. The mention of the hashtag "#NotreDameCathedralFire" ties it directly to that event. 

The emotion here seems positive because they're expressing gratitude for a substantial contribution towards rebuilding something important. Gratitude often falls under joy or happiness, but I need to check the mapping guidelines.

According to the guidelines, if the emotion is similar to serenity or ecstasy, classify as joy. In this case, the tweet isn't overly ecstatic, but it's definitely a positive sentimentâ€”expressing thanks and support for rebuilding efforts. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or sadness here; instead, it's about appreciation and hope for restoration.

So, considering all that, the primary emotion is joy because it's a positive response to a generous donation aimed at restoring something significant.
