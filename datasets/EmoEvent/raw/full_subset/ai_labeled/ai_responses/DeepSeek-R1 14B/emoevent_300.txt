Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says, "Happy Wednesday folks! üòÅ Hoping for a Messi masterclass later. ü§û#BARLIV #ChampionsLeague". 

First, looking at the words used: "Happy" is right there in the beginning. That's a strong indicator of joy. The emoji used is a smiley face, which also supports that emotion.

The author is expressing excitement about Messi possibly putting on a great performance later. They're using an emoji with their hands together, which I think is like a prayer or hoping gesture, showing eagerness and positive anticipation.

Considering the context given, it's related to the UEFA Champions League, which is a big football competition. The mention of Messi adds to the excitement because he's a well-known player. So, the tweet isn't just about happiness; it's also about looking forward to something enjoyable.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: Joy includes emotions like serenity or ecstasy. While the tweet isn't serene, there's definitely a sense of positive anticipation and excitement, which falls under joy.

I don't see any signs of other emotions like anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise. The overall tone is upbeat and hopeful.
