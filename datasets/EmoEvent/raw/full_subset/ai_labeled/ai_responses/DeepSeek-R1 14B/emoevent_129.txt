Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The tweet says, "To read and write stories is my greatest joy. #WorldBookDay" with a link.

First, let's break down the words used. The author mentions that reading and writing stories bring them their "greatest joy." Joy is a strong positive emotion, so that's a direct clue. They're expressing happiness related to books and storytelling.

Looking at the context provided, World Book Day is about promoting reading and literature, which aligns with the tweet's focus on reading and writing as a source of joy. The use of "greatest joy" emphasizes how important this activity is to them.

Now, considering the mapping guidelines: if the emotion is similar to serenity or ecstasy, it falls under joy. Since the author expresses their love for reading and writing with enthusiasm, that fits into the joy category.

I don't see any signs of other emotions like anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise here. The tone is positive and celebratory, focusing on personal happiness from engaging in literary activities.
