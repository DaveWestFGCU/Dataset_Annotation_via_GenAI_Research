Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says, "Here’s to all the badass bitches in Westeros #GameOfThrones #BattleForWinterfell." 

First, let me break down the components. The phrase "Here’s to" is often used as a toast or an expression of praise. "Badass bitches" definitely has a positive connotation here; it's a compliment highlighting strength and coolness. The mention of Westeros refers to the setting of Game of Thrones, which is known for its complex characters and epic battles.

The hashtags #GameOfThrones and #BattleForWinterfell are clearly related to the show and a specific event in the series. The link provided likely leads to more content about this battle or perhaps fan reactions.

Now, considering the emotions: "badass bitches" suggests admiration and respect for strong female characters. The tone is celebratory and appreciative. There's no indication of any negative feelings like anger or disgust. It doesn't seem fearful because it's talking about a fictional battle that's probably been resolved by now. Joy seems likely because the user is praising something they care about, but let me think deeper.

The tweet isn't expressing pure joy; it's more about acknowledging and celebrating strong characters. However, in the context of the mapping guidelines, if the emotion is similar to serenity or ecstasy, it would be joy. But this feels more like admiration and pride, which might lean towards joy because it's a positive sentiment.

Wait, but could it be surprise? The mention of "badass bitches" might be surprising in some contexts, but here it's more about praise. So probably not surprise. It doesn't fit the secondary emotions for surprise like distraction or amazement.

Looking back at the guidelines: if it's a toast to badass characters, that's admiration and positive sentiment, which aligns with joy. Alternatively, could it be sadness? No, because there's no indication of grief or pensiveness.

So, considering all this, I think the emotion here is joy.
