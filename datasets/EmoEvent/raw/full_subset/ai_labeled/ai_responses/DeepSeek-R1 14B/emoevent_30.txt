Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Messi's free kick. The user wrote, "Such a masterpiece of a free kick. That is what Messi is made of. #messi messing with USER. #BarcaLiverpool #ChampionsLeague #BarçaLFC #BarcelonaLiverpool." 

First, I'll break down the content. They're praising Messi's free kick as a masterpiece, which clearly shows admiration and appreciation. The hashtags also relate to football clubs like Barcelona and Liverpool, indicating excitement about the match or event.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: joy is associated with serenity or ecstasy. Since the tweet expresses awe and positive feelings towards Messi's skill, it fits under joy. There's no indication of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise here; it's purely celebratory.
