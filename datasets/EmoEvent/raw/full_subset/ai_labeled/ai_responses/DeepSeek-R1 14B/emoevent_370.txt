Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let me read it carefully.

The user starts with "USER USER USER" which seems like they're addressing someone or maybe emphasizing their message. Then they say, "Give them a date & time, I'm certain volunteers would be swarming to help sweep & clean up at #NotreDameCathedralFire to lift the hearts of our Brothers and Sisters in Paris." They end with "That's how we roll! #MormonHelpingHands" and a link.

The tone here is positive. The user is suggesting organizing volunteers to help after the fire, aiming to uplift people in Paris. Words like "swarming," "help," "sweep & clean up," "lift the hearts," and "That's how we roll!" all have a hopeful and proactive vibe. They're offering support and showing solidarity.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger is about annoyance or rage, which isn't here. Disgust is more about dislike, not applicable. Fear would involve anxiety or terror, but the tweet is about helping, so that's not it. Joy is about serenity or ecstasyâ€”maybe, but let me think deeper.

The user is expressing willingness to help and a positive outlook, which could be seen as joy because they're focused on making a positive impact and showing support. Alternatively, it might also touch on surprise if the situation is unexpected, but I think the primary emotion here is more about positivity and hope.

So, considering all that, the emotion conveyed is likely joy.
