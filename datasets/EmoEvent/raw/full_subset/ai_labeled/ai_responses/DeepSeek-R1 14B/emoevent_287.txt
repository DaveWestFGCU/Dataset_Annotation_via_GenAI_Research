Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Barcelona winning La Liga again. Let me break it down.

The tweet starts with hashtags like #Barcelona, #Champions of #Laliga, and mentions 8 trophies in 11 years. The author is clearly celebrating a victory. They use emojis like ⚽️ which adds to the celebratory tone. Phrases like "Well done," "Congratulations," and "Special congratulations" all express positive feelings.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Since the tweet is full of praise and happiness, it's definitely not any negative emotion. The author is expressing pride and satisfaction in Barcelona's success. That fits under joy because they're showing excitement and happiness about their team's achievement.

I don't see any elements of surprise here; it's more about celebrating a known victory rather than being amazed by something unexpected. So, the primary emotion is joy.
