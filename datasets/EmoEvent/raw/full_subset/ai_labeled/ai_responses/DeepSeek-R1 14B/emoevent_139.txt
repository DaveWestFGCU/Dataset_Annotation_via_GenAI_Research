Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. The user is talking about millennials and Gen X paying attention to what's happening in Socialist Venezuela. They mention that THIS is socialism and what eventually happens. They also call out specific users as radicals who will destroy us and ask why young Venezuelans are protesting.

First, I notice the use of words like "hope," which can indicate a desire or concern. The exclamation marks suggest some level of emphasis or urgency. The tweet seems to be warning others about the consequences of socialism, using Venezuela as an example. They're expressing frustration with certain individuals they label as radicals and are concerned about the future.

The overall tone feels more like a cautionary message mixed with criticism. However, looking at the emotion categories: anger is about annoyance or rage; disgust is for dislike; fear is about apprehension; joy is positive feelings; sadness is pensiveness; surprise is amazement.

I think the user's main emotion here is frustration and concern, which might fall under anger because they're expressing strong disapproval towards radicals and socialism. Alternatively, it could be fear if they're worried about the future, but I feel more aligned with anger because of the critical tone towards specific actions and individuals.
