Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. Let's break it down.

The tweet says: "Game of thrones. Episode 3. No comment. Nothing at all. Just fucking amazing. #GameofThrones"

First, the user mentions "No comment" and "Nothing at all," which might seem like they're not expressing much. But then they say "Just fucking amazing." The word "amazing" is a strong positive adjective, and the use of "fucking" adds emphasis, indicating high enthusiasm.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Since the tweet expresses excitement and praise, it's leaning towards joy. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or sadness. The user is clearly impressed and happy about the episode.

So, the primary emotion here is joy.
