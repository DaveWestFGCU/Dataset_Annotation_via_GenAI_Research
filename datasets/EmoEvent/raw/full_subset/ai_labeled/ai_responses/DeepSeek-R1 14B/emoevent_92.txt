Record: "USER USER USER_Org USER   Still think #Venezuela is a #Socialist paradise? I'm more that happy to buy you a first-class, one-way ticket so you can show your solidarity and maybe use some of your millions to buy food for those starving. https://t.co/Jy7eFLoJvn"

Okay, let's try to figure out the emotion in this tweet. The user is talking about Venezuela being a socialist paradise and suggests buying someone a ticket to show solidarity, but also mentions using their money to buy food for the starving. 

Hmm, the tone seems sarcastic. They're probably mocking the idea that Venezuela is a socialist paradise. Sarcasm often conveys frustration or irritation, which falls under anger. The user isn't expressing happiness or surprise; instead, they're showing annoyance at the situation.

So, considering the guidelines, sarcasm and mockery are forms of secondary emotions like annoyance, which should be classified as anger.
