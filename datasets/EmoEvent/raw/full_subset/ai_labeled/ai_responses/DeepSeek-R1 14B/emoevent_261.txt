Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says, "That was a delightful, deliciously deserved drubbing #ChampionsLeague." 

First, let's break down the words used here. "Delightful" and "deliciously" are positive adjectives, which immediately make me think of joy or happiness. The word "drubbing" usually refers to a severe beating or defeat, but in this context, it seems like the person is talking about a football match where one team won convincingly. So, "delightful drubbing" suggests that the speaker is happy about the victory.

The hashtags also give some context: #ChampionsLeague, which is a competition where teams compete to be the best in Europe. The tone here seems celebratory, using words like "delightful" and "deserved," indicating satisfaction with the outcome.

Looking at the mapping guidelines, joy is associated with emotions like serenity or ecstasy. While "delightful" isn't exactly ecstasy, it's a positive emotion that fits under joy. There's no indication of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise here. The speaker seems pleased and happy about the result.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion is joy.
