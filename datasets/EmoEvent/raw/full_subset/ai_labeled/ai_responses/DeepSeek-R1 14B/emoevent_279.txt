Record: "Another #GameofThrones complaint: the battle for the throne is supposed to be a subplot in relation to the ultimate clash between ice and fire, and should have been redefined not only politically but metaphysically by the larger demand that all ally against the Dead."

Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user is talking about complaints regarding the battle for the throne being a subplot instead of something more significant. They mention it should have been redefined politically and metaphysically as part of the larger demand against the Dead.

Hmm, let's break this down. The tweet is pointing out what they see as a flaw in the series' structure, specifically how the battle for the throne was handled. They're expressing dissatisfaction with how the story was developed, especially in relation to the main conflict between ice and fire.

So, looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet isn't expressing happiness or excitement; it's more about frustration. But is it anger or disgust? Anger is usually when someone is annoyed or enraged, while disgust relates to dislike or disapproval.

The user seems to be criticizing the showrunners' decisions, which indicates a sense of disappointment or disapproval rather than outright anger. They're pointing out what they see as a mistake in the series' direction. This feels more like disgust because it's about disliking how something was handled, rather than being enraged.

I think the emotion here is disgust because the tweet expresses a dislike for how the battle subplot was treated.
