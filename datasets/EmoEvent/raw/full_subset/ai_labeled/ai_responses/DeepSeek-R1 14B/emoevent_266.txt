Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The user says they're not much of a reader but love giving books to avid readers and also don't mind receiving them. They added a smiley face, which is a hint towards their mood.

First, let's break down the words. "Not much of a reader" might sound negative at first glance, but it's followed by positive actions: loving to gift books and enjoying receiving them. The smiley emoji reinforces that they're feeling good about this exchange.

The context is World Book Day, which is all about promoting reading and sharing books. So the user isn't just talking about themselves; they're engaging in an activity that aligns with the spirit of the day. Their focus seems to be on the joy of giving and perhaps the pleasure of receiving, which are both positive emotions.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet doesn't show any negative feelings; instead, it's about sharing something they care about. The smiley face definitely points towards a happy or joyful sentiment.

I don't see any signs of fear, surprise, or other emotions here. It's all about the positive aspects of exchanging books. So the emotion should be joy.
