Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Champions League. The user is saying, "See what am saying. It’s over bro! Klopp got it all wrong tonight. #BarcaLiverpool #ChampionsLeague." 

First, let's break down the content. They mention that it's over and criticize Klopp, who is a manager known for his tactical skills. Using words like "got it all wrong" suggests frustration or disappointment. The use of "bro" adds a casual tone but also might indicate urgency or emphasis on their point.

The hashtags are #BarcaLiverpool, which refers to Barcelona vs Liverpool, so the tweet is about that match. If Klopp made mistakes, the user is likely upset with how his team performed. The phrase "it's over" could imply that the game has concluded in a way that's disappointing for them.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: anger includes annoyances or rage. Disappointment and frustration can fall under anger because they're related to irritation or dissatisfaction. There's no indication of disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise here. The focus is on criticizing Klopp's decisions, which points more towards anger rather than other emotions.

So, the primary emotion seems to be anger due to the frustration expressed about the game's outcome and Klopp's performance.
