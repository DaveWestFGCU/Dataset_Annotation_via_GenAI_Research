Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is talking about donations from the elite and questioning why they don't address bigger issues like world famine or homelessness instead. They also express frustration with the lack of new solutions.

Hmm, looking at the words used: "super rich donations," "why can’t," "end World Famine," "homelessness," "something new & revolutionary." The tone seems critical and disappointed. They're pointing out a contrast between what's happening (donations to a cathedral) and what they see as more pressing issues.

The user is clearly upset about the situation, showing frustration with the priorities of the elite. This frustration could be classified under anger because it's directed at a specific group for not acting as expected. There's also an element of disappointment, which can tie into anger when someone feels let down or betrayed.

I don't think it's disgust because they're not expressing revulsion towards something but rather frustration with actions (or lack thereof). Fear isn't present here; it's more about the reaction to a situation. Joy and surprise are out of the question since the sentiment is negative. Sadness might be possible, but the primary emotion seems more directed at anger due to the critical tone.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed is likely anger because of the frustration and criticism aimed at the elite for not addressing bigger issues.
