Okay, I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user mentioned they talked about the "devastating" fire on their podcast and expressed gratitude that it's happening. Hmm, that seems contradictory because usually, a devastating event would evoke sadness or fear, but here they're thankful for it? That doesn't make sense at first glance.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The tweet says, "We are so #thankful this is happening." But the fire was actually a negative event. So expressing gratitude about something bad happening seems off. Perhaps there's a typo or misunderstanding in the tweet. Maybe they meant to express that they're thankful it didn't happen elsewhere? Or maybe they're sarcastically thankful?

Alternatively, perhaps the user is relieved that the fire happened and now people are paying attention, but that still doesn't fit neatly into any emotion category. The primary emotions listed include anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Given the mention of devastation and their podcast discussing it, they might be expressing sadness about the event. But then why say they're thankful? Maybe the gratitude is misplaced or a typo. Alternatively, maybe they're surprised that such an event happened, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The user could be expressing relief or gratitude that something bad didn't happen to them personally, but in this case, it's about the cathedral. That still doesn't fit well.

I think the most straightforward emotion here is sadness because they're talking about a devastating event and using the word "thankful" might not override the negative context. Alternatively, maybe surprise if they're reacting to the unexpectedness of the fire, but I'm leaning towards sadness as the primary emotion.
