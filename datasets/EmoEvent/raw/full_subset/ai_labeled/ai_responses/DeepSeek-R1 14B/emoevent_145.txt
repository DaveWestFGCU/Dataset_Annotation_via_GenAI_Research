Okay, I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is talking about people setting up fake donation accounts and pocketing money. They're advising others to do proper research before donating. This seems like they're warning others to avoid scams, which shows concern or caution. But looking at the emotion labels, I have to choose from anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

The tweet isn't expressing happiness (joy) or surprise. It's more about frustration with people taking advantage of a tragic situation. That frustration could be seen as anger, but it might also be disgust because they're talking about unethical behaviorâ€”people exploiting the fire for their gain. Disgust often relates to disapproval or dislike of something wrong.

So, considering the context and the message, the emotion is likely disgust because the author is expressing disapproval towards the scam artists.
