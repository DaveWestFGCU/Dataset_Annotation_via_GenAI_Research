Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is sharing a news report that the fire department's chaplain rescued the crown of thorns. They end with "What an amazing story!" 

First, let me break down the components. The event itself was tragic—the fire destroyed part of the cathedral—but the tweet isn't focusing on the destruction. Instead, it highlights a specific act: saving the crown of thorns by the chaplain. Using words like "amazing" and exclamation points suggests positive emotions.

The phrase "What an amazing story!" indicates admiration or awe. The user is impressed by the chaplain's action. So, the emotion here isn't sadness about the fire but rather a sense of wonder or amazement at this particular rescue.

Looking at the mapping guidelines, surprise includes reactions like distraction or amazement. Since the tweet expresses astonishment at the chaplain's heroic act, it fits under surprise.
