Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The user is congratulating someone on defending their La Liga title and then encouraging them to go for a double. Words like "Congrats" and "successful defense" sound positive. They're celebrating an achievement and looking forward to more success. The hashtags also seem supportive, mentioning Team Messi and Barça, which are usually associated with pride and excitement. There's no negative language here; everything is uplifting and hopeful. So the emotion conveyed is definitely joy.
