Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says, "Luis Suarez 1-0! Alba üëè Best left back in the world #Bar√ßaLFC #ChampionsLeague." 

First, let's break down the content. Luis Suarez scored a goal (1-0), which is a common way to denote a score in football. The mention of Alba and calling him the best left back suggests admiration or praise. The use of üëè emojis usually signifies applause or approval.

The hashtags #Bar√ßaLFC and #ChampionsLeague indicate that this tweet is related to FC Barcelona and the UEFA Champions League, which are both significant in football culture. 

So, putting it all together, the author is celebrating a goal by Suarez and praising Alba's performance. The emojis and positive language like "Best left back" show enthusiasm and approval.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: joy is associated with serenity or ecstasy, but more relevantly here, it's about expressing positive feelings. Since the tweet is full of praise and celebration, the primary emotion is joy.
