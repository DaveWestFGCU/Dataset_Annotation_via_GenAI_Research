Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the context: The Notre Dame Cathedral fire happened on April 15, 2019. It was a significant event that caused a lot of emotional reactions worldwide.

Now, the tweet itself is a bit lengthy, but I can parse through it. The user starts with hashtags like #USA and #America, then mentions donating millions to rebuild Notre Dame and also references Puerto Rico. They mention that Americans can't get more donations without criticism from Trump and his administration. Then they bring up kids in the US not having access to gym, music, Spanish, or any second language classes. The tweet ends with "sad!!! ðŸ™ƒ" and a link.

So, the user is expressing frustration about how the U.S. is donating to Notre Dame but facing criticism from Trump while also pointing out issues within the U.S., like kids lacking access to certain classes. They explicitly use the word "sad!!!" which indicates sadness. The face they used (ðŸ™ƒ) might be a bit sarcastic or mocking, but combined with the explicit emotion word, it's clear that sadness is the primary emotion here.

I should also consider if there are any other emotions present. There's frustration about donations and criticism, which could lean towards anger, but the dominant emotion expressed is sadness because of the use of "sad!!!" and the context of kids not having access to essential classes, which evokes pity or sorrow.
