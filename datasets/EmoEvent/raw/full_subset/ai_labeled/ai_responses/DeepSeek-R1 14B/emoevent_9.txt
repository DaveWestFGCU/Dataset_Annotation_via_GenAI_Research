Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The tweet says, "This story will make your day! ðŸ˜Š Meet USER and share her empowering message for refugees and youth everywhere." There's a smiley face emoji, which usually indicates happiness or joy. The content is positive, talking about an empowering message for refugees and youth. The hashtags are related to World Book Day and books, which are generally uplifting topics.

Looking at the guidelines, if the emotion is similar to serenity or ecstasy, it should be classified as joy. The smiley face and the positive message both point towards a feeling of happiness or joy. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or sadness here. So, I think the primary emotion is joy.
