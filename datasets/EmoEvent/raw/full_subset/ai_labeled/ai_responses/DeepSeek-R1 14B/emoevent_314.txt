Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says, "And just like that Arya becomes the most popular baby name in 2020. #GameofThrones #got https://t.co/UJuzcvGlZc". 

First, let me break down what's happening here. The user is pointing out that Arya from Game of Thrones has become a popular baby name. They're using the word "just like that," which suggests something happened quickly or unexpectedly. The hashtags are about Game of Thrones and GOT, so they're clearly referencing the show.

Now, thinking about emotions: the tweet isn't expressing anger, disgust, fear, joy, or sadness directly. It's more about a surprising factâ€”Arya being a popular name. So the emotion here is likely surprise because it's highlighting something unexpected happening in pop culture related to the show.

I don't think it's any of the other emotions. There's no indication of happiness beyond the fact that Arya is popular, but that doesn't reach the level of joy. It's not sad or fearful; it's more about an interesting observation. Disgust and anger aren't present either. So yeah, surprise seems to fit best because it's pointing out something surprising and maybe a bit amusing.
