Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral Fire. The user was branded as an "almighty half wit" by a fire chief from West Yorkshire for their tweet, which was called "ludicrous." 

First, let's break down the words used here. The fire chief is calling the user a "half wit," which is clearly a derogatory term implying that the user isn't very intelligent or sensible. Then he refers to the tweet as "ludicrous," meaning it's absurd or ridiculous.

So, how does this make the author feel? Being called a halfwit and having their tweet labeled ludicrous likely made them feel mocked or belittled. That kind of response usually evokes feelings of anger because someone is openly criticizing or laughing at them in public.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: if it's similar to annoyance or rage, we classify it as anger. Here, mockery and being called out publicly would definitely fall under that category. There's no indication of fear, joy, sadness, disgust beyond the initial insult, or surpriseâ€”just clear frustration and irritation.

Therefore, the primary emotion here is anger.
