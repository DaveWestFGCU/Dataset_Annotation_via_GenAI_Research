Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion behind it. The user is talking about Venezuela taking its oil off the Petrodollar and how that affects Americans' standard of living. They mention a possible collapse of the world economy if the dollar defaults and China taking over, which they see as getting "even alot worst."

First, I notice the language used here. Words like "ATTACK," "HIGH STANDARD OF LIVING," "COLLAPSE," and "WORST" are in all caps, which often indicates strong emotions. The user is expressing concern about economic instability and foreign influence, specifically from China.

Looking at the context provided, there's a crisis in Venezuela regarding who the legitimate president is. This adds to the tension because decisions made by either Maduro or Guaido could have significant international repercussions. The tweet seems to suggest that this action by Venezuela poses a serious threat to the global economy and American interests.

The emotion here isn't just worry; it's more about fear of potential economic collapse and foreign domination. The user is projecting negative outcomes with words like "COLLAPSE" and "WORST," which convey a sense of dread or apprehension. They're not angry at someone specifically but worried about the broader implications.

Comparing this to the mapping guidelines, fear is associated with emotions like apprehension or anxiety. The tweet fits into that category because it's expressing concern about future negative events—economic collapse and Chinese takeover—which are fearsome prospects.

I don't think it's anger because there's no direct accusation or personal attack. It's more about the consequences of actions rather than a specific grievance. Disgust doesn't fit either since there's no clear dislike expressed towards something. Sadness would involve mourning, which isn't present here. Joy and surprise are clearly not applicable given the negative tone.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion is fear due to the anxiety about economic collapse and foreign influence.
