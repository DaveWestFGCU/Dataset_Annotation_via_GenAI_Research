Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet is asking a question about whether a story regarding Maduro's willingness to leave Venezuela is true. It seems like the author is seeking information or clarification on the situation.

Looking at the context provided, there's a political crisis in Venezuela with two sides: support for Maduro and Guaido. The tweet doesn't express any strong emotions like anger or fear; instead, it's more of a neutral inquiry. However, according to the guidelines, I can't label it as neutral. So I have to choose from the given options.

The emotion here might be sadness because the situation in Venezuela is serious and people are concerned about their country's future. Alternatively, maybe surprise if the tweet is reacting to unexpected news, but the tone seems more questioning than surprised.

I think the primary emotion is sadness because it reflects concern or empathy for the ongoing crisis.
