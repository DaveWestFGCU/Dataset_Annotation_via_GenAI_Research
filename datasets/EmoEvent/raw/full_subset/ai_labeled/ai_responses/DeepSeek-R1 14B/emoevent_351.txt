Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says, "My favourite moment of #BattleofWinterfell was Sam turning and just running away from a white on a battlefield full of them ðŸ˜… #gameofthrones." 

First, let's break down the content. The user is talking about their favorite moment from the Battle of Winterfell episode. They mention that Sam turned and ran away from a "white" (probably referring to the White Walkers) in a battlefield filled with them. The use of ðŸ˜… suggests they found this moment amusing or funny.

Now, considering the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The user is expressing their favorite moment, which was Sam running away. The emoji used is a laughing one, indicating humor. So, the primary emotion here seems to be joy because they're highlighting a moment that made them happy or amused.

I don't think it's anger because there's no indication of frustration or rage. Disgust doesn't fit either since there's nothing negative about the action described. Fear isn't present; instead, the user is enjoying the scene. Sadness and surprise also don't apply here. The key emotion is joy due to the positive reaction and the laughing emoji.
