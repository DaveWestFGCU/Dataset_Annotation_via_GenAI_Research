Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion. The user wrote, "I hope Liverpool would beat Barcalona USER ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüìø amen Tonight #ChampionsLeague #MoSalah #Liverpool." 

First, I notice they're expressing a desire for Liverpool to win against Barcelona in the Champions League. They included several emojis: a heart, hands together, and a praying hand with a ring. These emojis often symbolize hope, prayer, or strong positive feelings.

The hashtags like #ChampionsLeague and mentions of Mo Salah (a key player) show excitement about the event. The use of "amen" suggests they're hoping for a positive outcome in a fervent way.

Putting it all together, the user is clearly rooting for their team and expressing optimism. This aligns with feelings of hope and positivity, which falls under joy because it's about looking forward to something good happening.
