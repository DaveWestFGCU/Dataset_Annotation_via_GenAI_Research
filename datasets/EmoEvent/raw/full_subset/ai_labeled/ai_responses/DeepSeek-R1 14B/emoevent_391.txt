Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Greta Thunberg and some political groups. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet starts with calling a coalition of violent ideologies from certain parties like AfD and UKIP as white supremacists and human supremacists attacking Greta Thunberg. The author uses words like "vile" which definitely has negative connotations. They also mention science denial being linked to carnism, anthropocentrism, speciesism, and racism.

So the main points are criticizing these groups for their ideologies and their attack on Greta. The language is strong and condemnatory. Words like "vile," "science denial," and the hashtags about supremacisms all indicate a negative sentiment.

I need to map this to one of the six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let's think about each:

- Anger: This is when someone is annoyed or enraged. The tweet seems more than just annoyed; it's a strong condemnation.
- Disgust: This involves disliking something or feeling it's repulsive. The author clearly dislikes the ideologies and actions of these groups, so this could fit.
- Fear: Not really present here; there's no indication of fear.
- Joy: Definitely not, as the tone is negative.
- Sadness: There's some negativity, but more about disapproval rather than sadness.
- Surprise: No element of surprise in the tweet.

Between anger and disgust. The tweet isn't just angry; it's expressing a deep dislike for these groups' actions and ideologies. "Vile" suggests a strong sense of disgust. So I think disgust is the primary emotion here because it's about disliking something morally.
