Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The user is asking who will win and mentions they've bet $10,000, asking for help to win it. They're using several hashtags related to Barcelona vs Liverpool and the Champions League.

Hmm, the emotions listed are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Let's see. The tweet expresses excitement about a big match and a significant bet. Betting money can be stressful, but here they're asking for help, which might indicate hope or eagerness. They seem invested in the outcome, maybe feeling anxious or hopeful.

Looking at the guidelines: fear is related to apprehension or anxiety. So if they're worried about losing the bet, that's fear. Alternatively, joy could relate to serenity or ecstasy, but I think the stress of a high-stakes bet leans more towards fear.
