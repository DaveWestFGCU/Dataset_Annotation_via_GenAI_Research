Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The user is talking about how reading books in Spanish can help improve one's language learning and lifestyle. They're using exclamation marks which usually indicate positive emotions. Words like "Happy" and phrases that suggest improvement ("improve your way of life") are definitely upbeat. There's also a sense of enthusiasm with the hashtags and the link provided, which might be promoting something they believe in. The overall tone seems encouraging and joyful, so I think the emotion here is joy.
