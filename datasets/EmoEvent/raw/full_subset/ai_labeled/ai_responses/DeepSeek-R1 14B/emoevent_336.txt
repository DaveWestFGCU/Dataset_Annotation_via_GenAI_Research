Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Messi winning his 10th LaLiga title. Let me break it down.

The tweet says: "10th #LaLiga title for the number 10. The best in the world. Leo #Messi ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ https://t.co/L0h9BL2ArX"

First, I notice that the user is celebrating Messi's achievement. They mention it's his 10th title and call him the best in the world. The emojis used are fire emojis (ðŸ”¥), which often symbolize excitement or enthusiasm.

The context is about a football league, specifically La Liga, so this is likely from a football fan. The tone seems positive and full of praise for Messi. Words like "best" and "10th title" indicate pride and accomplishment.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: joy includes emotions like serenity or ecstasy. This tweet definitely feels ecstaticâ€”celebratory and filled with happiness about Messi's success.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise here. It's all about celebrating a great achievement, so the primary emotion is joy.
