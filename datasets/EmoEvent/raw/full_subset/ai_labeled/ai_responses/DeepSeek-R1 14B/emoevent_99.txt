Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet regarding Venezuela's political crisis. The user is responding to someone who has been talking about Venezuela for a long time. They express sympathy by saying they're sorry to see what's going on and then mention hoping and praying for change.

First, let me break down the words used. "Sorry" indicates empathy or concern. "Hope and pray" suggests a desire for positive outcomes. These phrases don't show strong negative emotions like anger or fear but rather a wish for improvement. The overall tone seems supportive and hopeful without any signs of joy or excitement. There's no indication of surprise either, as it's more about expressing sympathy and hoping for change.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger would involve frustration or rage, which isn't present here. Disgust is about dislike, but again, not applicable. Fear might come with anxiety, but the tweet doesn't express that. Joy would be if they were happy about something positive, but it's more about wishing for change. Sadness could fit because of the sympathy expressed, but I'm not sure if it's the primary emotion.

Wait, the user is expressing empathy and a desire for betterment, which might lean towards sadness because of the situation's seriousness. However, they're also hopeful, so maybe joy? But hope without strong positive emotions doesn't quite reach joy. Alternatively, surprise isn't there either.

I think the primary emotion here is sadness because the user is showing concern and sympathy for the ongoing crisis. They're not happy or fearful; instead, they're expressing empathy for the difficult situation in Venezuela.
