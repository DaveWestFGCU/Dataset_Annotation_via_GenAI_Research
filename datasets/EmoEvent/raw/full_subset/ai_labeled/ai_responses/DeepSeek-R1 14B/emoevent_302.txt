Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The user wrote, "USER USER Correct. USER pls dump these arrogant and disrespectful fans out of the #ChampionsLeague." Hmm, let me break this down.

First, the mention of "dump" suggests that the user wants something or someone removed. They're talking about fans being arrogant and disrespectful. So, they're clearly upset with how these fans are behaving. The words "arrogant" and "disrespectful" are strong negative adjectives, which indicates frustration or anger.

I should consider the emotion mapping guidelines. Anger is associated with secondary emotions like annoyance or rage. Here, the user seems annoyed by the fans' behavior and wants them removed, showing a clear sign of anger. There's no indication of disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise in this context. The focus is purely on the negative feelings towards the fans.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion here is anger because the user is expressing frustration and wanting to remove these fans due to their arrogance and disrespect.
