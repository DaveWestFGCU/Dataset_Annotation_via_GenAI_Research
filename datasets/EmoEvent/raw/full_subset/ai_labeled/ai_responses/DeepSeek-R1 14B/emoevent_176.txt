Record: "USER USER USER On this extremely rare occasion, I agree with you. Senator. Having said that, I will never forgive your obeisance to the orange Putin puppet in the White House. He needs to get out of #Venezuela and let the adults handle this."

Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. The user starts by saying they agree with someone on a rare occasion, which might indicate some level of agreement or acknowledgment. But then they quickly shift tone. They mention "obedience to the orange Putin puppet," which sounds like a strong criticism or dislike towards that person. The use of words like "puppet" and "orange" (probably referring to Donald Trump) suggests mockery or contempt.

The tweet ends with a demand for someone to leave Venezuela, implying frustration with the current situation. The overall tone seems negative, focusing on disapproval and anger towards certain political figures. There's no indication of fear, joy, or surprise; it's more about expressing irritation and strong dislike. So, considering the guidelines, this fits under anger because it's a secondary emotion similar to annoyance or rage.
