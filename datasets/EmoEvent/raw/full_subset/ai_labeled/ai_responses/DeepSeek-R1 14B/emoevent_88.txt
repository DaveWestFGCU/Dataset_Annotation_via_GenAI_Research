Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet is about Messi's free kick being unbelievable and mentions it's his 600th club goal. It also tags the Champions League and BARLIV, which I think stands for Barcelona vs. Liverpool.

First, let me break down the words used. "Unbelievable" is a strong positive word, showing that the person is really impressed or amazed by Messi's goal. The emojis like üêê (which I believe represents Messi as a goat) and the use of hashtags related to the Champions League show excitement about the event.

The tweet doesn't express any negative emotions like anger or sadness. Instead, it's all about celebrating an incredible moment in football. Words like "unbelievable" and "n what a goal" clearly indicate awe and amazement. So, considering the guidelines, when someone is expressing amazement or being distracted by something amazing, that falls under surprise.

I don't think it's joy because while it's positive, joy usually relates to happiness rather than astonishment. Fear isn't there either; the tweet is about a great achievement, not something scary. Disgust and anger are out of the question since the tone is entirely positive.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion here is surprise because the author is expressing amazement at Messi's incredible goal.
