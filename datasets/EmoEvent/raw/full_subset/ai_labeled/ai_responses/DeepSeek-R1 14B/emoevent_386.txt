Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says, "Legit. You're fighting the DEAD. And you place the most vulnerable in a place full of fucking dead people!? Really!?" with the hashtag #GameOfThrones.

First, let me break down the words and tone used here. The word "Legit" is slang for legitimate or serious, often used sarcastically. Then there's repetition of "You're fighting the DEAD," which emphasizes that they're dealing with dead people, maybe zombies or undead from the show. The use of "fucking" in "full of fucking dead people" adds a strong negative emotionâ€”probably frustration or anger.

The exclamation marks and rhetorical questions like "Really!?" also indicate surprise or disbelief. So, is this more about anger or surprise? The person seems upset but also shocked at the situation described.

Looking back at the mapping guidelines: Anger includes annoyances or rage, while surprise includes amazement or distraction. Here, the tweet combines frustration (anger) with shock (surprise). But which one is primary?

The strong language and emphasis on the absurdity of placing vulnerable people in such a dangerous spot seem to convey more frustration than mere surprise. The use of "fucking" is a strong indicator of anger. So even though there's an element of surprise, the primary emotion seems to be anger.

Therefore, I should classify this tweet as anger.
