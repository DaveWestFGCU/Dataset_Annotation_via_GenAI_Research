Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the primary emotion. The user starts by tagging #cdnpoli and mentioning Mike Hudema and Greta Thunberg, who is known for her climate activism. They express support for "Water Protectors," which shows solidarity and positive feelings towards those fighting for environmental causes.

Next, the tone shifts with some strong language: "WHY is %$#@& alton - full of gaseous gas - gas going unpunished?" The use of expletives like "%$#@&" indicates frustration or anger. They're questioning why something harmful (gas) isn't being addressed, which suggests they're upset about the situation.

Then, they address Justin directly: "YOU FIX THIS!" This is a direct call to action, showing impatience and urgency. The overall message combines support for activists with strong criticism towards those in power, particularly using harsh language to convey their dissatisfaction.

Considering the guidelines, frustration and anger fit under the primary emotion of anger. There's no indication of other emotions like fear or surprise; it's more about expressing irritation and a desire for action.
