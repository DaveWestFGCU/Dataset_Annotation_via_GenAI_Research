Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says, "USER spreading #ConspiracyTheories during his interview about the #NotreDameCathedralFire is absolutely disgusting! #FearMonger #GoAway." 

First, let's break down the words and hashtags used. The user is calling out another person for spreading conspiracy theories regarding the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. They use the word "disgusting," which immediately makes me think of disgust. But I should consider other emotions too to make sure.

The tweet also includes hashtags like #FearMonger, which suggests that the author might be implying fear is being spread. However, the primary emotion expressed in their own statement seems to be directed at the user's behavior. The word "disgusting" is a strong negative emotion, indicating dislike or厌恶 (dislike). 

Looking at the mapping guidelines: disgust includes secondary emotions like disinterest or loathing. Since the tweet explicitly uses "disgusting," that fits under disgust. While there are mentions of fear in the hashtags, the author's direct expression is about their own feelings towards the user's actions, which is disgust.

So, I think the primary emotion here is disgust.
