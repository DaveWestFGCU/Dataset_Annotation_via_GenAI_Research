Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The user is Greta Thunberg, known for her climate activism. The tweet says, "I'm scared...please world, do something to change #climatechange..." 

First, looking at the words used: "scared" is a strong indicator of fear. She's expressing her feelings directly. The context is about climate change, which is a serious and pressing issue, so it makes sense that she'd feel scared.

The hashtags like #ClimateBreakdown and #ClimateEmergency also emphasize the urgency and severity, which would contribute to feeling afraid. There's no indication of other emotions like anger or sadness here; it's pretty straightforward fear.

So, based on her words and the context, the emotion is clearly fear.
