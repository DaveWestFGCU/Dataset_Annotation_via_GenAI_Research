Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is asking why they didn't save the whole cathedral with a miracle instead of just the cross. They're using multiple thinking emojis and some mmm sounds.

Hmm, let's break it down. The tweet expresses frustration or disappointment that only part of the structure was saved. The repeated "hmm" and the questioning suggest they're not happy about the outcome. But is this anger or something else?

Looking at the guidelines: Anger includes annoyances or rage. Disappointment can sometimes fall under anger if it's more irritation, but in this case, the user seems to be expressing a sense of letdown rather than outright anger.

Wait, maybe it's sadness? Because they're sad about losing part of the cathedral. But the tone here feels more like frustrationâ€”hoping for a miracle and being let down. That leans towards anger because of the annoyed or irritated feeling.

Alternatively, could it be surprise? They might be surprised that only the cross was saved, but I think the emotion is more negative than that. It's more about the disappointment and frustration, which points to anger.
