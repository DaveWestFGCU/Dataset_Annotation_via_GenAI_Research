Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let me read it again: "After such a long weekend, make today a #TerrificTuesday !!! Don't miss this exciting workers day promo offers below! DM Now for details! #IRCAtraining #iso #WorkersDay #promos #Discountoffer #TuesdayThoughts #WorldBookDay #tenolalpha https://t.co/boClACLO9o"

Hmm, the tweet starts with "After such a long weekend," which might indicate relief or excitement about the end of the weekend. Then it says "make today a #TerrificTuesday !!!" The use of exclamation marks and the word "terrific" suggests enthusiasm or joy.

Next, there's a call to action: "Don't miss this exciting workers day promo offers below!" Again, words like "exciting" and "promo offers" are positive and promotional. They're trying to create excitement and encourage people to take action.

The hashtags include #WorldBookDay, which is a celebration of books, so that's a positive event. The overall tone seems upbeat and encouraging, with lots of enthusiasm about the day and promotions.

I don't see any negative words or sentiments here. Everything points towards positivity, promotions, and excitement. So the primary emotion conveyed is joy.
