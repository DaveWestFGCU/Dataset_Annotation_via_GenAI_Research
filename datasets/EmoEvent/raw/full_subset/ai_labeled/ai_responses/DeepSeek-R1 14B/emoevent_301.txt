Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a tweet and wants me to classify the primary emotion conveyed using one of six labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says, "Saddened by the violence witnessed in #Venezuela #OperacionLiberdad. Images I hoped would not be witnessed in modern Latin America." The word "saddened" immediately stands out as an indicator of emotion. 

"Saddened" directly relates to sadness. The tweet is expressing regret or sorrow about the violence happening in Venezuela. There's no indication of other emotions like anger or fear; it's a straightforward expression of feeling downhearted.

Looking at the context provided, there's a political crisis in Venezuela with conflicting support for two leaders. The tweet doesn't take sides but focuses on the emotional response to the violence. 

According to the mapping guidelines, if the emotion is similar to pensiveness or grief, it should be classified as sadness. Since "saddened" fits perfectly into that category, there's no need to consider other options.

I also note that the user emphasized only providing one word from the specified list and not including any explanations. So, my response must be concise and just the emotion label.
