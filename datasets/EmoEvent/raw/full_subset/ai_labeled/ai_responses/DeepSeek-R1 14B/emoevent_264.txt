Record: "Brilliant and an emotional episode #GameofThrones especially with #LyannaMormont. She may have been the youngest but she stood her ground &amp; defeated a terrible threat (giant) to which I'm confident strategically speaking benefited the chances of "the living side!"  #GirlPower https://t.co/RqRMTP36JW"

Alright, let's tackle this query. The user has provided a tweet about Game of Thrones and wants me to classify the primary emotion conveyed as one of anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It mentions that the episode was "brilliant" and "emotional," especially highlighting Lyanna Mormont's role. The author praises her for standing her ground against a giant, which they believe strategically benefited the living side. They also use the hashtag #GirlPower, which suggests admiration or respect.

The key words here are "brilliant," "emotional," "stood her ground," "defeated a terrible threat," and "strategically speaking." These all indicate positive feelings towards the episode and Lyanna's character. The tone is uplifting and shows appreciation for her strength and impact.

Looking at the emotion categories, joy fits because the tweet expresses admiration and praise, which are positive emotions. There's no indication of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise. The focus is on celebrating a strong female character and the success in overcoming a threat, both of which align with joy.
