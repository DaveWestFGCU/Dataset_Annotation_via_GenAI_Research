Alright, let me try to figure out what emotion this tweet is conveying. The user provided a tweet about Suarez being called a "classless prick" during the Champions League game between Barcelona and Liverpool. 

First, I notice that the author is using strong language towards Suarez, calling him a "prick," which is a derogatory term. This indicates some negative feelings towards him. The mention of the Champions League game adds context about where this behavior occurred.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet isn't expressing any positive emotions like joy or serenity. It's definitely not fear or surprise either; those don't fit here. Sadness might come into play if there was a personal loss or something, but that's not the case.

The key emotion here seems to be disgust. The author is showing disdain for Suarez's actions, which aligns with feelings of dislike or loathing. While anger could also be a possibility because of the strong language, disgust fits better when considering the secondary emotions like disinterest or dislike mentioned in the guidelines.

So, I think the primary emotion here is disgust.
