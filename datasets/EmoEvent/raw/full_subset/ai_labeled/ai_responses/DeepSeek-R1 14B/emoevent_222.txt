Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion. The user wrote, "Henderson getting bitched by that Rat 🐀 Alba #ChampionsLeague #BarcaLiverpool." 

First, I notice the mention of Henderson and Alba, who are likely football players given the context of the Champions League. The word "bitching" here is slang for complaining or criticizing harshly. So, Henderson is being criticized by Alba.

The use of the word "Rat 🐀" as an insult towards Alba adds a layer of disrespect. Using an animal like a rat to describe someone often conveys disgust or disdain. The emoji of a rat reinforces this negative sentiment.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet isn't expressing anger directly but rather a strong dislike or厌恶 towards Alba's behavior. This fits more under disgust because it's about feeling repulsion or aversion towards someone's actions.

There's no indication of fear, joy, sadness, or surprise in the tweet. It's more about the negative feelings directed at Alba for criticizing Henderson.
