Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user wrote: "The rich folk just broke USER Endgame's opening weekend collection #NotreDame #NotreDameCathedralFire #NotreDameCathedral USER USER #endgame #Avengers #AvengersEndgame". 

First, I notice that the tweet is mixing two topics. The first part mentions "The rich folk just broke" which seems to be about the Notre Dame fire, as it's tagged with related hashtags. But then it switches to talking about "Endgame's opening weekend collection," specifically mentioning Avengers: Endgame.

I'm trying to understand the emotion here. The user is complaining that the rich disrupted something, possibly the movie's opening. Maybe they're frustrated or annoyed because of this disruption. Alternatively, they might be expressing disappointment or dislike towards how the event affected their plans or interests.

Looking at the mapping guidelines, if it's a secondary emotion like annoyance or rage, it should be classified as anger. The tweet seems to express frustration about the rich people causing a problem, which could be seen as annoyed or angry. There's no clear sign of other emotions like fear, joy, sadness, or surprise here.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion is likely anger because of the frustration expressed towards the disruption caused by the rich folk.
