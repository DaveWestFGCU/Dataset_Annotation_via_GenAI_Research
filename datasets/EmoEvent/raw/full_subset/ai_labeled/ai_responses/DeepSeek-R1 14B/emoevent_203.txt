Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. Let me read it again: "Books are our never failing friends. Must Read & Learn The Noble Qur'an presents by the Lord of Aalamin." 

Hmm, the user is talking about books being reliable friends and emphasizes reading and learning the Qur'an as a noble presentation from God. This seems positive because they're encouraging reading and highlighting the value of the Qur'an. There's no negative language here; instead, it's more about appreciation and promotion.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet doesn't show any signs of anger or frustration. It's not expressing dislike either. Fear isn't present because there's nothing scary mentioned. Sadness is also absent since the tone is uplifting.

The key words here are "never failing friends," "Must Read & Learn," and praise for the Qur'an. These suggest a sense of enthusiasm and positivity, which aligns with joy. The user seems to be celebrating books and promoting knowledge, which is a joyful sentiment.
