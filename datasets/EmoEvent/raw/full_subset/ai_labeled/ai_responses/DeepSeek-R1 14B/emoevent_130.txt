Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet says: "Happy 90th Birthday Joanna Macy! üíê Listen to the conversation that I had with her for the USER here: https://t.co/pdOHyUc7AT ‚Ä¶ #thegreatturning #ClimateStrike #GretaThunberg #postcapitalism #podcast #FridayMotivation #workthatreconnects https://t.co/saf58TaOoK"

First, I notice the tweet starts with "Happy 90th Birthday Joanna Macy!" which is clearly a celebratory message. The use of a flower emoji üíê also adds to that positive vibe.

The author then invites others to listen to their conversation with Joanna Macy, which suggests they're sharing something positive or inspiring. The hashtags used are #FridayMotivation and #workthatreconnects, both of which imply motivation and positivity related to climate strikes and similar causes.

There's no negative language here; everything seems upbeat and encouraging. The mention of Greta Thunberg is likely in a supportive context given the overall tone.

So considering all this, the primary emotion conveyed is joy because it's a birthday celebration and sharing positive content.
