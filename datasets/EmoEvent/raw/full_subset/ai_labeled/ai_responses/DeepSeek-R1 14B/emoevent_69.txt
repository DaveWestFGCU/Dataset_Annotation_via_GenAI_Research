Okay, let's analyze this tweet step by step. The user is talking about World Book Day and mentions they're working their shift while reading a novel. They've read 1136 pages and have 325 left. They also reference being part of theatre and mention the book "A Little Fall of Rain." 

The tone here seems positive because they're celebrating reading, making progress in their book, and sharing their enthusiasm with others who are into theatre. There's no negative language or signs of distress. Instead, it's more about engagement and excitement.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet doesn't show any of the first four. It's not expressing anger or disgust; there's no indication of fear or sadness. However, the user is sharing their progress with enthusiasm, which aligns with joy. They're happy about reading and their achievements.

So, the primary emotion here is joy.
