Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. Let's break it down.

The tweet says, "Thats #Gameofthrones over for me. They killed the only guy i liked in the show. ðŸ‘Ž". The user is talking about the series ending for them because their favorite character was killed. 

First, I notice the mention of a specific event: the death of a beloved character. That usually evokes strong emotions. The word "killed" here is pretty intense and suggests something negative happened.

The reaction emoji used is ðŸ‘Ž, which typically signifies approval or praise. But in this context, it's probably sarcastic because the user is expressing disappointment about the show ending due to their favorite character's death. So, the emoji might be a way of saying "Well done" but with a negative twist.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The user isn't happy or joyful; they're clearly upset because their favorite character died. They also mention it's over for them, indicating they won't continue watching, which shows disappointment and sorrow.

So, the primary emotion here is sadness. The user feels grief about losing a character they cared about, leading to the end of their engagement with the series.
