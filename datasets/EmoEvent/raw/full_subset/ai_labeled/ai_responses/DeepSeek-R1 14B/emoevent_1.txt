Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The tweet is talking about some amazing books and mentions "reading pleasures" which sounds positive. They also mention influencers, which could imply inspiration or influence leading to joy. There's no negative language here; it's all about enjoyment and appreciation of books. So I think the emotion here is joy.
