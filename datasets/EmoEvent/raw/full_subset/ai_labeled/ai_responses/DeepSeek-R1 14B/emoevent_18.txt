Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says, "Theon, you're a good man. Thank you." and includes some hashtags related to the show.

First, let me break down the content. The user is addressing Theon and calling him a good man, then thanking him. This seems positive. The word "thank" usually indicates gratitude or appreciation, which are associated with joy or happiness. 

Looking at the context provided, Game of Thrones is known for its complex characters and emotional storylines. The mention of specific episodes like #TheLongNight and #TheBattleOfWinterfell suggests that the user is reflecting on significant events in the series.

The emotion here doesn't seem to be any negative ones like anger or disgust. It's more about acknowledging a character positively, which aligns with joy. There's no indication of fear, sadness, or surprise; it's straightforward gratitude.

So, considering all this, the primary emotion is joy.
