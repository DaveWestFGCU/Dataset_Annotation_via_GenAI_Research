Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet starts with "#ExtinctionRebellion = #youngpeople taking their future into their own hands...!!!! :)". The user is expressing support for young people involved in Extinction Rebellion, which is an environmental movement. They're using a lot of exclamation marks and a smiley face, which usually indicates positive emotions.

Next, they mention "With some pretty incredible supporters behind them too!!" Again, the use of exclamation marks suggests enthusiasm or excitement. The supporters include #banksy and #GretaThunberg, who are both well-known figures in environmental activism. The tweet ends with a thank you message and a link to a user.

Looking at the context provided, Greta Thunberg is known for her passionate advocacy against climate change, which often conveys strong emotions like determination or urgency. However, in this specific tweet, the author is expressing gratitude and admiration towards the young people and their supporters. The tone is uplifting and supportive.

Considering the mapping guidelines: joy is associated with serenity or ecstasy, but more importantly, it's about positive emotions. The use of smiley faces and exclamation marks points to a feeling of happiness or satisfaction. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or sadness here.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet is joy.
