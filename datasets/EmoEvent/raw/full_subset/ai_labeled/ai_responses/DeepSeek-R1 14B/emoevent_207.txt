Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet by Greta Thunberg. The tweet says, "That damned Global warming strikes again.... #GretaThunberg  https://t.co/IuR5OpZ9r7". 

First, let's break down the words used. She uses "damned" which is a strong word, often expressing frustration or anger. The phrase "strikes again" could imply that global warming is causing repeated problems, which might be frustrating or upsetting.

Greta Thunberg is known for her activism regarding climate change, so this tweet is likely about the ongoing issues with global warming. The use of "damned" suggests she's expressing negative feelings towards it. 

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Since she's using strong language and talking about a recurring problem, I think it's more about frustration or anger rather than something like fear or sadness.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion here is probably anger because of the strong language and the context of her activism against climate change.
