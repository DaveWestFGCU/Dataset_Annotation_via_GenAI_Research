Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says, "Theon's death hit me the hardest in #GameOfThrones like fuck." 

First, let's break down the words used. The user mentions that Theon's death was the hardest for them and uses the word "fuck" which is a strong expletive. This indicates some sort of negative emotion.

Looking at the context, Game of Thrones is known for its intense storylines and character deaths, so it's common for fans to have strong reactions. The use of "hit me the hardest" suggests that the user felt a significant impact from this event.

The word "fuck" adds intensity to their statement, showing frustration or anger. They're expressing dissatisfaction or outrage about Theon's death. There's no indication of fear, joy, disgust, sadness beyond what's expected for a character's death, or surprise. It's more directed towards the way it was handled or the outcome.

So considering the emotion mapping guidelines, if the tweet conveys something similar to annoyance or rage, we classify it as anger. The use of strong language and the frustration expressed fits under anger rather than other categories like disgust or sadness.
