Record: "I feel like I'm saying this every week but am I the only one who thought #GameofThrones was actually really poor this week?   Awfully shot and full of flimsy logic with a massively bloated runtime as well. This season is shaping up worse than the last one, big disappointment."

Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user starts by saying they feel like repeating themselves every week, which suggests frustration or maybe even anger. They express that they're disappointed with the latest episode, pointing out issues like poor shooting, flimsy logic, and a bloated runtime. These are all negative points.

The word "disappointment" stands out because it directly relates to feeling let down or unhappy. The user is clearly not happy with how the show is progressing, comparing this season to the last one as worse. They're expressing dissatisfaction and frustration, which aligns more with sadness rather than anger because they're reflecting on their overall disappointment rather than just being enraged.

Looking at the guidelines, sadness includes emotions like pensiveness or grief. The user's repeated expression of disappointment and their detailed critique suggest a deeper sense of unhappiness rather than just momentary irritation. So, I think the emotion here is sadness.
