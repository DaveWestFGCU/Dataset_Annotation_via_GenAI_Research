Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. Let me read it again: "#WorldBookDay The More U Read The More U Know... It is the Day for one of my Best Friend... Enjoy Ur Day BookðŸ“š https://t.co/nwPFNzW4Wl"

Hmm, the user is talking about reading and knowledge, which sounds positive. They mention it's a day for one of their best friends, which adds a personal touch. The use of emojis like the book suggests they're happy or excited. Words like "Enjoy Ur Day" also convey positivity.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Since the tweet is promoting reading and celebrating a friend, it's likely expressing joy. There's no indication of any negative emotions here.
