Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Venezuela's crisis. Let me read it again: "FACT #Venezuela Coup is the 1st military operation The DEEPSTATE and TRUMP have worked on Together WELL DONE GUYS USER USER". 

Hmm, the user mentions a coup involving the deep state and Trump, which suggests they're talking about some sort of conspiracy or collaboration. They end with "WELL DONE GUYS," which sounds positive. So maybe they're supporting this action.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet seems approving, so that's a positive emotion. Joy is one of the options, but sometimes people might use terms like 'ecstasy' or 'serenity' for joy. Alternatively, maybe it's more about pride or satisfaction.

Wait, "WELL DONE" could indicate approval or happiness with the outcome. So I think the primary emotion here is joy because they're expressing support and positivity towards the situation.
