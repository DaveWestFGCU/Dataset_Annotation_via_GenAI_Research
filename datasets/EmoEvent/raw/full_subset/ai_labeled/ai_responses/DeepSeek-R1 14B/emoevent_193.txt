Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Venezuela's crisis. The user is talking about how Western news outlets aren't covering the rallies against a US-backed coup attempt. They mention that it doesn't advance their pro-war agenda.

Hmm, the tone here seems critical and frustrated. The author is pointing out what they see as media bias or manipulation. That kind of frustration can be linked to anger because they're upset about the situation and feel let down by the news outlets.

I don't think it's disgust because that usually involves something revolting or loathing, which isn't exactly the case here. Fear would involve anxiety or terror, but the tweet is more about frustration with media coverage rather than fear of a threat. Joy and surprise are clearly not applicable since the content is negative. Sadness might be possible if it's about grief, but again, the primary emotion seems to be frustration leading to anger.

So yeah, I think the emotion here is anger because of the frustration expressed towards the media's inaction or bias.
