Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire. The tweet says that 'Assassin's Creed: Unity' could help with the restoration and mentions it's the best news ever. 

First, let me break down the content. The user is talking about a video game potentially aiding in the restoration of a historic site that was recently destroyed by a fire. They express excitement by calling it "the best news ever." 

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: joy includes emotions like serenity or ecstasy. Here, the person seems thrilled and positive about the situation. There's no sign of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surpriseâ€”just clear enthusiasm.

So, the primary emotion here is joy because they're expressing happiness and excitement about a positive development related to a tragic event.
