Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is talking about modernist architects wanting to redesign the cathedral into a shopping mall after the fire. Hmm, that sounds like they're upset or annoyed with such a suggestion.

The guidelines say if it's similar to annoyance or rage, classify as anger. So yeah, the author seems angry at the idea of exploiting the tragedy for commercial purposes.
