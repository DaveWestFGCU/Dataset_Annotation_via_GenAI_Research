Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user posted a picture 5 years ago with a caption that they find hilarious now because of the recent event. They're using emojis and hashtags related to the fire.

Hmm, the word "hilarious" suggests joy or humor. But considering the context is a tragic eventâ€”the destruction of such an iconic cathedralâ€”it's possible the user feels irony or shock. The tweet seems to point out a coincidence in their old post, which might be surprising or unexpected.

I'm thinking about the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. "Hilarious" points towards joy, but given the tragic event, maybe it's more of a surprised reaction because of the coincidence. So I'm leaning towards surprise as the primary emotion here.
