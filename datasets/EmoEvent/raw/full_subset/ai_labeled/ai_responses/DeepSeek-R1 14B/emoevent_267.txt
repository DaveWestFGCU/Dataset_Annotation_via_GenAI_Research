Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet is from Greta Thunberg, who's known for her climate activism. She says, "“I want you to panic!”" with some hashtags related to her movement and events.

First, let me break down the words. "I want you to panic!" That's a strong statement. Panic implies fear or urgency. So she's directly telling people to feel panic, which is a strong emotion. The use of exclamation marks also adds intensity.

Looking at the context, Greta Thunberg is known for being very vocal about climate change and often uses strong language to convey the urgency of the situation. Her message here seems to be pushing for action by instilling fear or anxiety about the current state of the environment.

Now, considering the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Which one fits best? The tweet is asking people to panic, which relates to fear. It's not necessarily anger because she's not expressing frustration towards someone but rather trying to evoke a sense of urgency and fear about the climate situation.

So, I think the primary emotion here is fear. She wants people to feel that way to encourage them to take action.
