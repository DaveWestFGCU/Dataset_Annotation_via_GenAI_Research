Record: "Y’all hate that #GameOfThrones ending but I love it.... I don’t think it is the end of the #NightKing but it was an epic moment for #Arya!! Plus #Jorah , #Lyanna and #Theon got a noble death... no off we go to kill Cersei and then I think the Night King will resurface..."

Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user is talking about the ending of the series. They mention that others hate it but they love it. Then they list some characters who had noble deaths and express excitement about upcoming events like killing Cersei and the Night King resurfacing.

Hmm, the author seems positive because they explicitly say they love the ending. They're highlighting the epic moments for Arya and the deaths of other characters in a favorable way. The mention of future actions against Cersei shows enthusiasm. So overall, it's a happy sentiment.
