Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire. The user is sharing their own photos and expressing that they can't capture the beauty justice, but they're posting to mourn with others over an impossible loss. 

First, let's break down the words used. "Mourn" suggests sadness or grief. They mention it's an "impossible loss," which indicates something tragic and irreversible. The use of hashtags like #NotreDameCathedralFire also points to a serious event.

The author is expressing personal feelings about the destruction, showing empathy with others who are affected. Words like "mourn" and "collective" imply a shared sorrow. There's no indication of anger or fear here; it's more about the emotional impact of losing something significant.

So, considering the guidelines, sadness fits because they're expressing pensiveness or grief over the loss.
