Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion. The user is talking about a hypothetical future in 2030 and reminiscing about Liverpool winning the 91 points trophy in 2019. They mention that everyone else doesn't remember, which might indicate some nostalgia or longing for past achievements.

Looking at the hashtags, they include #mufc (Manchester United Football Club), #ChampionsLeague, #youryear, #nextyear, and mentions of Liverpool vs Barca. The user seems to be expressing pride in Liverpool's past success but also a sense of looking forward, possibly hoping for future victories.

The tone doesn't seem negative or positive in an extreme way. It's more reflective and hopeful. Considering the emotion categories, joy would fit because they're recalling a happy time and expressing anticipation for future successes. There's no clear sign of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise here.
