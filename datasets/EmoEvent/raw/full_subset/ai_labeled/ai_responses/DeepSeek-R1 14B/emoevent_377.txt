Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is pointing out that while a lot of money was raised for the cathedral after it burned down, there are homeless people all over the world who get nothing. They express amazement with the ðŸ¤” emoji and mention poverty-related hashtags.

First, I should break down the tweet's content. The author is clearly frustrated or upset about the disparity between the attention given to the cathedral and the neglect of homelessness. But they also use "amazing" which might indicate surprise at how quickly funds were raised despite the ongoing issues with homelessness.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: if it's similar to distraction or amazement, classify as surprise. The word "amazing" fits here, showing surprise at the situation. However, there's also an element of frustration and sadness about the neglect of homeless people. But the primary emotion seems to be the reaction to the contrastâ€”feeling surprised by how much attention and money went to the cathedral while homelessness is ignored.

So, considering all this, I think the emotion here is surprise because of the use of "amazing" and the emoji, even though there's underlying sadness about the situation.
