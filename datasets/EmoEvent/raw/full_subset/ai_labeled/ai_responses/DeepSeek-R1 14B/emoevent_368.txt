Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user wrote, "It’s in the heart, it’s in the body, it’s in the DNA of Parisians. It’s a national tragedy." 

First, let's break down the words used. They mention it being in the heart and body, which suggests a deep emotional connection. Using terms like "DNA" implies that this is something inherent or fundamental to Parisians' identity. The phrase "national tragedy" clearly indicates a sense of loss on a large scale.

The emotion here seems to be one of profound sadness. When someone refers to an event as a national tragedy, they're expressing grief and mourning. The use of words like "heart," "body," and "DNA" emphasizes the emotional depth and personal connection, which aligns with feelings of sorrow or sadness.

I don't think it's anger because there's no indication of frustration or rage. Disgust doesn't fit either since there's no expression of dislike or aversion. Fear isn't present as there's no sense of apprehension or anxiety. Joy and surprise are also out of the question because the context is a tragic event, not something positive or surprising.

So, considering all this, the emotion here is sadness.
