Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let me read it again: "Leo Leo! Best player. So it's done. #LaLiga". Hmm, the user is talking about Leo Messi, calling him the best player and using an excited tone with "Leo Leo!" That sounds like they're really happy or maybe even celebrating something.

The context mentions that this is from La Liga, which is a top football league in Spain. So, the tweet is likely about a recent event in the league where Messi has done something impressive or perhaps won another title. The exclamation marks and the use of "Best player" indicate strong positive feelings.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Since the user is expressing excitement and praise, it's probably joy. They're celebrating Messi's performance, which brings happiness or elation. There's no sign of any negative emotions here; everything seems upbeat and positive.
