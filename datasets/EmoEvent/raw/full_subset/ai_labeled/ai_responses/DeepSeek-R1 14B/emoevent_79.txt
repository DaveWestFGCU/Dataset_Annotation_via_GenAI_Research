Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says, "Happy #WorldBookDay! Follow our librarian, Max Crowther, on Twitter USER for the occasion! https://t.co/giqmuL5pss". 

First, the tweet starts with "Happy", which immediately makes me think of joy or happiness. World Book Day is an event promoting reading and books, so it's likely a positive message. The author is encouraging people to follow Max Crowther on Twitter, probably to share more about books or library stuff.

Looking at the words used: "Happy" is a strong indicator of joy. There are no negative words here; everything seems upbeat and celebratory. The mention of a librarian and promoting reading further supports that this is meant to be positive and encouraging.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise. It's all about celebrating books and sharing information in a cheerful way. So the emotion conveyed here is definitely joy.
