Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet is: "No shoe !!. Too arrogant or too ignorant #GretaThunberg #Leitrim #sligoleitrimgreens #climatechange #geai #leitrimlen #carrickonshannon https://t.co/Zuwb74DQQk"

First, I'll break down the content. The tweet starts with "No shoe !!" which seems a bit abrupt and maybe a typo or emphasis on not having a shoe. Then it says "Too arrogant or too ignorant." So the author is calling someone either arrogant or ignorant.

Looking at the hashtags: #GretaThunberg, so this is related to her movement. The other hashtags are about location and climate change topics. 

The main message here is criticism towards Greta Thunberg, labeling her as either arrogant or ignorant. This suggests that the author has a negative view of her actions or stance.

Now, considering the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

Criticism can often be associated with anger because it's a form of frustration or irritation. Alternatively, it could also be seen as disgust if the author feels disdain for her behavior.

But in this case, the tweet is more about expressing disapproval rather than feeling disgusted. So I think anger fits better here because it's a direct criticism that likely stems from frustration or annoyance.
