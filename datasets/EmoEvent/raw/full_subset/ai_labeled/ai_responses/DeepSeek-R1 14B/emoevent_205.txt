Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet starts with "I knew it .... I knew it .... I knew it!!!" That repetition of "I knew it" suggests that the author had aÈ¢ÑÊÑü or prediction about something happening, maybe the fire. The exclamation marks indicate excitement or perhaps relief.

Next, they say "Thank you #SkyNews" which is expressing gratitude towards Sky News for providing information. Then, "The High Altar is untouched." This seems positive because the altar wasn't damaged. They also mention that "Not even the candles are melted!" So, the author is relieved and happy that certain important elements were spared.

Then there's "*Paws up.....high 5* üêæ" which uses a paw emoji and high five gesture. These emojis usually convey excitement or happiness. The hashtags used are #NotreDameFire, #NotreDameCathedralFire, #NotreDame, and #believe. The word "believe" might indicate hope or positivity.

Putting it all together, the author is expressing relief and joy that despite the fire, some parts of the cathedral were untouched. They're thankful and happy about the outcome regarding the High Altar and candles. The use of emojis like paws up and high five adds to the celebratory tone.

So, considering the guidelines, joy fits because it's a positive emotion related to serenity or ecstasy. The author is expressing happiness and relief, which aligns with joy.
