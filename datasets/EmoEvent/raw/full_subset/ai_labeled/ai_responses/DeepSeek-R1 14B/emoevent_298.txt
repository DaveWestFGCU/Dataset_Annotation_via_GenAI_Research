Record: "Guaidó wants you to believe that he is the only responsible and democratic alternative to the authoritarian "usurper" Maduro, but what he is doing in #Venezuela right now is incredibly dangerous and irresponsible: he is actively pushing the country to the brink of civil war."

Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. The tweet mentions Guaidó and Maduro, who are key figures in the conflict. The author is criticizing Guaidó, saying his actions are dangerous and irresponsible, pushing the country towards civil war.

First, let me break down the words used: "dangerous," "irresponsible," "pushing the country to the brink of civil war." These terms suggest a strong negative sentiment. The tone isn't just critical; it's expressing concern about the potential consequences of Guaidó's actions.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines, I need to see which primary emotion fits best. Anger is associated with annoyance or rage, disgust with disinterest or dislike, fear with apprehension or anxiety, joy with serenity or ecstasy, sadness with pensiveness or grief, and surprise with distraction or amazement.

The tweet isn't expressing anger directly but rather a sense of worry about the situation escalating. The author seems anxious about the possibility of civil war, which falls under fear because it's about apprehension or terror related to future events.

I should make sure I'm not confusing this with disgust, which would be more about disliking someone or something. Here, it's more about the fear of negative outcomes rather than dislike for Guaidó himself.

So, considering all that, the primary emotion here is fear because the tweet expresses anxiety about the dangerous situation and potential civil war.
