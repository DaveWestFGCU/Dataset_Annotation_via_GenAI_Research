Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. Let's break it down.

The tweet says, "Watching USER watch GoT Red Wedding on insta is my favourite ðŸ˜‚ #GameofThrones." The user is talking about watching someone else watch the infamous Red Wedding episode on Instagram, and they find that amusing enough to be their favorite activity. They also added a laughing emoji and a relevant hashtag.

First, I notice the use of "ðŸ˜‚," which is an emoji representing laughter. That's a strong indicator of joy or happiness. The phrase "is my favourite" suggests that this experience brings them particular enjoyment. The mention of the Red Wedding might be referencing how intense or dramatic it was, but in this context, the user isn't expressing sadness or anger about it; instead, they're finding humor in watching someone else's reaction.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: joy is associated with emotions like serenity or ecstasy, which can include amusement and laughter. The other options don't fit as well here. There's no sign of anger, disgust, fear, or surpriseâ€”just clear indicators of happiness.

So, considering all this, the emotion here is definitely joy.
