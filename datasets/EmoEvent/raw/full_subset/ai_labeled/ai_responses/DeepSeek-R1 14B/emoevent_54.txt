Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet is about World Book Day and it's promoting a reading list of books by and about refugees. Let me break it down.

First, the context mentions that World Book Day is organized by UNESCO to promote reading, publishing, and copyright. So, the event itself is positive, focusing on literature and education.

Looking at the tweet: "On #WorldBookDay, be inspired by these amazing books by and about refugees! Our reading list with USER ðŸ“š  https://t.co/80DOcykOdf". The words used are "inspired," "amazing," and emojis like a book. These all have positive connotations.

The author is encouraging others to read these books, which suggests they want to share something valuable or uplifting. There's no negative language here; instead, it's about celebrating literature and refugee stories, which can be seen as inspiring or heartwarming.

Considering the emotion categories: anger would involve frustration or rage, disgust with dislike, fear with anxiety, joy with happiness, sadness with grief, and surprise with amazement. The tweet doesn't show any of the negative emotions; it's all about promoting something positive.

So, the primary emotion here is likely joy because they're sharing something inspiring and positive to encourage others. It's a call to action that aims to uplift people through literature.
