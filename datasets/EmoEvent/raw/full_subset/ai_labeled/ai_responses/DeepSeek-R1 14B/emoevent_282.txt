Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet is about Venezuela's presidential crisis, comparing it to a hypothetical situation where a white driver in a white-majority country faces similar circumstances. The author uses "Wow" and poses a rhetorical question, which makes me think they're expressing surprise or amazement.

The context mentions that the crisis started on January 10th, 2019, with people supporting either Maduro or Guaido. The tweet seems to be pointing out a double standard in how situations are perceived based on race and nationality. By imagining a different scenario, the author is highlighting a contrast between actual events and hypothetical ones, which could evoke surprise because it's unexpected or draws attention to an undercurrent of bias.

The use of "Wow" at the beginning suggests that the author finds this situation surprising or unbelievable. The rhetorical questions are meant to make others consider how international reactions might differ based on race and country demographics. This makes me think the emotion is more about pointing out a disparity, which could be seen as surprising or attention-grabbing.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: surprise includes emotions like distraction or amazement. Since the tweet is making someone stop and think about a different perspective, it fits under surprise.
