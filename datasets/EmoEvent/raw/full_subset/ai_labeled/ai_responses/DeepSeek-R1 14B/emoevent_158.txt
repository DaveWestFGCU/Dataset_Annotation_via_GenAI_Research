Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says, "It’s ALL been about Arya hasn’t it. How very satisfying #GameofThrones." 

First, let me break down the content. The user is talking about Arya and mentions that it's all been about her. They end with "how very satisfying," which seems positive. The use of "satisfying" suggests a feeling of contentment or fulfillment.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to map this to one of these. Since the tweet is expressing satisfaction and presumably happiness about Arya's role, that points towards joy. 

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, or sadness here. The mention of "satisfying" aligns with joy because it indicates a positive emotion. There's no element of surprise either; it's more about the overall feeling of contentment regarding the series.

So, considering all this, the primary emotion is joy.
