Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet regarding the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is talking about how "you guys" started playing for the left and shutting down French officials on whether it was terrorism. They call it a joke but then mention letting Shepard Smith talk about collusion that didn't happen. They also use hashtags like #cnn and #fakenews.

Hmm, the tone seems critical and sarcastic. The user is mocking the media's focus on certain issues while dismissing others. Words like "joke" and "fakenews" indicate frustration or irritation. It doesn't seem to be fear, joy, or surprise. Sadness might come into play if it's about the event itself, but the tweet isn't expressing that directly.

The main emotion here is likely anger because of the sarcastic tone and criticism towards media coverage. They're annoyed with how the situation is being handled, so I'll classify this as anger.
