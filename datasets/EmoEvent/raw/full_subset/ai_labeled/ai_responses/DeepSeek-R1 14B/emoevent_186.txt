Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The user is talking about people worrying about Avengers Endgame spoilers but not caring about Game of Thrones spoilers. They express frustration by calling people "hypocrites" and using some strong language like "fucks sake." 

The emotions listed are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Since the tweet shows irritation and annoyance towards others for their lack of concern about GoT spoilers, it's leaning towards anger. They're upset and expressing frustration, which fits under anger rather than other categories.
