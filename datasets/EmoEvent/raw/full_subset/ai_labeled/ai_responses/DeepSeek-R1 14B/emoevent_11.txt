Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones and Deborah Riley. Let me break it down.

The tweet says, "Mad respect for Deborah Riley the production designer of #GameOfThrones this woman designs the set.. thats mad!" 

First, the word "mad" is used here, but I know that in British slang, "mad" can mean something like "extremely" or "very." So when they say "Mad respect," it's expressing a lot of respect. The user is praising Deborah Riley for her work on the set design.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: joy includes emotions like serenity or ecstasy. Here, the person seems impressed and happy about the production design. They're showing admiration, which aligns with positive feelings.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise in the tweet. It's all about appreciation and praise, so the emotion is likely joy.
