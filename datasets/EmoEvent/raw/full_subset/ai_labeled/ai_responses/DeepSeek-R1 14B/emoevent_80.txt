Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user wrote, "My God, (no pun intended) seeing this beautiful building on fire and the steeple collapse causes serious pain deep within my heart, gut, and mind." 

First, let's break down the words used. They mention "pain" in their heart, gut, and mind. That sounds pretty intense. The destruction of a beautiful building is described, which probably evokes strong feelings.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet isn't expressing happiness or surprise; it's more about the negative impact. It's not fear because they're not talking about being scared in the moment but rather the emotional pain after seeing the destruction.

The key words here are "pain deep within my heart." This indicates a sense of loss and sorrow, which aligns with sadness. The collapse of such an iconic building would likely cause grief or mourning, fitting into the sadness category.

I don't think it's anger because there's no indication of frustration or rage. Disgust doesn't seem right either since that's more about dislike. Fear is about being scared, and surprise is about something unexpected without negative connotations. So, sadness makes the most sense here.
