Record: "I'm not at all religious... like AT ALL. But this #NotreDameCathedralFire has me feeling really uneasy.  I know overall it sounds like it'll be rebuilt but after all its gone through... why now? I don't like it!"

Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user starts by saying they're not religious at all, which might make someone think they wouldn't care much about the event. But then they mention that the fire has made them feel really uneasy. Uneasy usually relates to feeling worried or anxious.

They also talk about knowing it'll be rebuilt but express doubt with "why now?" and end with "I don't like it!" The overall tone seems more concerned and anxious rather than angry or sad. They're not happy, but the unease points towards fear or anxiety, which falls under the fear category.
