Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The tweet says, "France wants us to pray for bricks? Fuck right off #NotreDameCathedralFire." 

First, let's break down the content. The user is reacting to an event where France might be asking for prayers or support regarding the fire. The response uses profanity and a dismissive tone. Words like "fuck right off" show strong frustration or anger.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: Anger includes secondary emotions like annoyance or rage. Here, the language used is clearly aggressive and shows irritation towards France's request. There's no indication of other emotions like fear or sadness; it's more about the reaction to being asked to pray for something as trivial as bricks, which might be seen as disrespectful.

So, considering all this, the emotion here is definitely anger.
