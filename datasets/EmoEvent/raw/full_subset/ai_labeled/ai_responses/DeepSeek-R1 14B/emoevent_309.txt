Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. Let's break it down.

The tweet says, "Again, gravely disappointed we didn’t get the 'Now I am ALL Bran!' line. #GameofThrones." The user is expressing disappointment because a specific line wasn't included in the show. 

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

Disappointment usually falls under sadness because it's about unmet expectations or feeling let down. The word "disappointed" directly relates to sadness. There's no indication of anger or frustration enough to classify as anger; it's more about the emotional letdown rather than rage. No elements of fear, joy, or surprise here either.

So, the emotion is sadness.
