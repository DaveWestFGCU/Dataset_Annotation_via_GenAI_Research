Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion behind it. The user is talking about Suarez's celebration after scoring against Liverpool, which used to be his club. They describe the celebration as "the ugliest thing you could see tonight." 

First, I notice the strong negative language hereâ€”"ugliest" is a pretty harsh word. That suggests the author isn't just mildly upset but really disgusted. The mention of it being against Liverpool, his former club, adds context about why this might be bothering him. Maybe Suarez's celebration felt inappropriate or disrespectful given their history.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger involves annoyance or rage, disgust is more about disliking something intensely. Here, the focus is on how ugly and distasteful the action was, which points towards disgust rather than anger. There's no indication of fear, joy, sadness, or surprise in the tweet; it's purely a negative reaction to Suarez's behavior.

So, considering all this, the primary emotion here is disgust.
