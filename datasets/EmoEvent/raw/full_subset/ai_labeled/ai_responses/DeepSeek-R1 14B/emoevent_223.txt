Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. The user is responding to someone named Jim Sciutto, saying he's absolutely wrong and that Guaido won the election. They also call Guaido the "rightly elected President" and express shame on Jim Sciutto.

First, I'll break down the words used. Words like "Absolutely wrong!" show strong disagreement. The user is clearly upset with Jim Sciutto's stance. Using terms like "shame on you" indicates frustration or anger towards him. They're supporting Guaido against Maduro, which suggests they have a strong opinion about who should lead.

The hashtags #Guaido and #Maduro are used to emphasize their support for one side and likely opposition to the other. The overall tone is confrontational and critical, which points more towards anger rather than any other emotion like fear or sadness.

I don't see any signs of joy or surprise here; it's more about expressing strong disapproval and frustration with someone else's viewpoint. So, considering all this, the primary emotion seems to be anger.
