Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let's read it carefully.

The tweet says: "King of #LaLiga! Substitute #Messi delivers title to #Barca with Levante win #FanaticalFootballClub #FanaticalFanClub #WhereWeShootAndYouScore #FFCNewsUpadate https://t.co/rpL0bdIvR2"

First, the hashtags are all related to football, specifically La Liga and Barcelona. The mention of Messi delivering the title suggests that Barcelona has won something significant, probably a league title.

The words "King of #LaLiga" indicate pride or excitement about their success. The use of "FanaticalFootballClub" and "FanaticalFanClub" definitely shows strong passion and enthusiasm. Also, "WhereWeShootAndYouScore" sounds like a celebration of goals and victories.

Putting it all together, the author is expressing happiness and excitement because Messi's substitution led to a win for Barcelona, which likely secured their position as champions. The overall tone is positive and filled with joy.
