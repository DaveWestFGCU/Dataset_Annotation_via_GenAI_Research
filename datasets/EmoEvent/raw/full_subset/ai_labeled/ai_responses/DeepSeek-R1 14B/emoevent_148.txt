Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet: "Hopefully VOX will be defeated. #SpainElection". The user is expressing a hope that a particular political party, VOX, gets defeated in the election. 

First, let's break down the words used. The word "hopefully" indicates a desire or wish for something to happen. In this case, the desired outcome is the defeat of VOX. Now, I need to determine what emotion corresponds to this sentiment.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: anger is associated with annoyance or rage, disgust with disinterest or dislike, fear with apprehension or anxiety, joy with serenity or ecstasy, sadness with pensiveness or grief, and surprise with distraction or amazement.

The user's tweet shows a clear desire for VOX to lose. This could stem from various emotions. If the author dislikes VOX, it might be disgust. Alternatively, if they are worried about what would happen if VOX wins, that could be fear. However, the primary emotion here seems to be more about wishing harm upon a political entity rather than fear of consequences.

Considering the context, elections often bring out strong emotions tied to one's political affiliations. Expressing hope for another party's defeat can indicate opposition or dislike towards them. So, this aligns with disgust because it reflects a negative feeling towards VOX and their potential influence.

I don't think it's anger because there's no indication of rage or annoyance specifically; it's more about the desire to see them lose. Fear would involve anxiety about what might happen if they win, but the tweet doesn't focus on that outcome. Sadness or surprise aren't really present here either.

So, putting it all together, the emotion is likely disgust because the author expresses a dislike towards VOX and hopes for their defeat.
