Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says, "Wow MESSI what a goal ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥#ChampionsLeague." Let me break it down.

First, the word "Wow" is an exclamation that usually indicates surprise or amazement. Then, they mention Messi and talk about "what a goal," which suggests something impressive happened. The use of multiple fire emojis (ðŸ”¥) adds to the excitement and enthusiasm.

Looking at the context provided, it's about the UEFA Champions League, a prestigious football competition. So, the tweet is likely from someone who's a fan of Messi or the Champions League, reacting to an exceptional moment in the game.

The emotion here isn't anger because there's no indication of frustration or rage. It's not disgust either; the language and emojis don't show dislike. Fear doesn't fit because there's nothing scary about the situation described. Sadness is also out of place since the tweet seems positive.

Joy could be a contender, but it usually relates to happiness or contentment. While the tweet is positive, the primary emotion here feels more like surprise due to the use of "Wow" and the emphasis on an impressive goal. The emojis are often used to express excitement or amazement, which aligns with surprise.

So, considering all this, the emotion conveyed in the tweet is surprise.
