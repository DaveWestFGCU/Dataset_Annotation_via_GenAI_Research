Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. The user says they listened to an "excellent, disturbing analysis" and questions if it's the start of a proxy war nearby. 

First, let me break down the words used. "Disturbing" is a strong indicatorâ€”it suggests something upsetting or concerning. The mention of a potential proxy war on their doorstep adds a sense of anxiety or apprehension. The hashtags like #geopolitics and #Venezuela also point towards a serious and possibly worrying situation.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines, if the tweet conveys secondary emotions similar to apprehension or anxiety, it should be classified as fear. "Disturbing" aligns with that because it's causing unease or worry about the situation described. The user isn't expressing outright anger or sadness but seems more concerned and anxious about the potential developments.

So, considering all this, the emotion here is fear.
