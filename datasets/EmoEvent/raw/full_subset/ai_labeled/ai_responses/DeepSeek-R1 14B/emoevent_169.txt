Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The user is talking about Greta Thunberg and her movement "Fridays for Future." They mention that wanting to stop humanity's destruction of the planet is seen as naive by privileged left-wing liberals who don't understand money and rational desire.

Hmm, the tone here seems critical or sarcastic towards those who dismiss climate action. The author is frustrated with the perspective that money and personal gain are more important than saving the planet. This frustration could be classified under anger because it's a strong negative emotion directed at others' views or actions.
