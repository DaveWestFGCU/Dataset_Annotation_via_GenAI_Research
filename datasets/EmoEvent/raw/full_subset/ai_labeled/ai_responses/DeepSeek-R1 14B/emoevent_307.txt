Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is talking about how it's secondary that the cathedral burned and emphasizes that the bigger issue is that a great Christian place has become more of a tourist spot for pictures than a place for prayer.

Hmm, let me break this down. The tweet isn't just about the fire; it's making a statement about the state of the cathedral before the fire. They're expressing disappointment or frustration with how Notre Dame was being used. So, what emotion does that convey?

Looking at the guidelines: if it's similar to pensiveness or grief, it's sadness. The user seems reflective and upset about the loss of meaning for the cathedral. They might feel sad because something important has been overshadowed by tourism.

I don't think it's anger because they're not raging; it's more of a mournful reflection. Disgust? Maybe not, since it's more about disappointment than dislike. Fear or surprise don't seem to fit here either. Joy is definitely out of the question.

So yeah, sadness makes sense because they're expressing grief over the symbolic loss rather than just the physical destruction.
