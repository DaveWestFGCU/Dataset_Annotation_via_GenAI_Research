Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user is talking about watching episode 3, "THE LONG NIGHT," and mentions stunning filmmaking and that the Battle of Winterfell didn't disappoint. They also used some hashtags like #GOT and #GameOfThrones.

Hmm, the words they're using are positive: "stunning" and saying it didn't disappoint. That sounds like they enjoyed it. So the emotion here is probably joy because they're expressing satisfaction and excitement about the episode.
