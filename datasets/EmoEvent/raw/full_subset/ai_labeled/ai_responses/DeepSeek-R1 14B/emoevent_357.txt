Okay, I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is giving advice on avoiding scams related to donations. They're emphasizing awareness and caution. This seems more like a call to action rather than expressing an emotion. But since the guidelines say every record must have one of the six labels, I'll choose the closest fit. Since they're advising against scams, it's about concern or caution, which might relate to fear but isn't directly expressed. Alternatively, maybe sadness because of the event, but the tweet is more informative than emotional. However, since there's no clear emotion, perhaps the safest label is surprise, as the situation is unexpected. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to go with fear because they're warning about potential dangers.
