Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says, "Messi. 599 & 600. Wow. #ChampionsLeague ⚽️". Let me break it down.

First, the mention of Messi is significant because he's a well-known and respected footballer. Then there are numbers: 599 and 600. I'm not exactly sure what those refer to, but given the context of the Champions League, maybe they're related to some statistics or records? The word "Wow" stands out as an expression of surprise or amazement.

The hashtag #ChampionsLeague and the football emoji ⚽️ reinforce that this tweet is about a football match or event. Putting it all together, the user is expressing excitement or astonishment regarding Messi's performance or some achievement in the Champions League. The use of "Wow" clearly indicates surprise.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, joy, or sadness here. It's more about being amazed by something impressive, which points towards surprise as the primary emotion.
