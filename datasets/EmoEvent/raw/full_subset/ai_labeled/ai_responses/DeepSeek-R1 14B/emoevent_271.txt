Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is talking about the "Crown of Thorns" and questioning how long thorns can last for 3000 years. They also mention being curious.

Hmm, let's break it down. The tweet starts with a rhetorical question: "#CrownOfThorns of Christ?......Are you kidding me?" That sounds like surprise or maybe confusion. Then they express doubt about the longevity of thorns lasting 3000 years, which could be skepticism. But then they add "just curious," so it's more about seeking information rather than anger or disgust.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: surprise is when there's distraction or amazement. The user seems surprised by something related to the fire and the cathedral's history. They're questioning a long-standing belief, which might make them feel amazed or taken aback.

I don't think it's fear because there's no indication of anxiety or terror. It's not sadness either; they're not expressing grief. Disgust doesn't fit here since there's no dislike involved. Anger is more about annoyance, which isn't present. Joy? Not really, as the situation is serious.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion seems to be surprise because of the curiosity and the rhetorical questioning.
