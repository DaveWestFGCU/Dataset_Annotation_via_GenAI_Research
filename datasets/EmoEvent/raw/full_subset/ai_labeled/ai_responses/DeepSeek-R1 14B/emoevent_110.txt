Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet by Greta Thunberg. Let me read it again: "We should all be reported for our Climate Change denial eventually. The politicising of the children is a good thing. #GretaThunberg #orwellian #thoughtcrime https://t.co/tHw2ec65vK"

Hmm, Greta Thunberg is known for her activism on climate change, so this tweet seems to be about that. She's talking about people being reported for Climate Change denial and mentions politicizing children as a good thing. The hashtags include #orwellian and #thoughtcrime, which are references to George Orwell's 1984, suggesting surveillance and control.

So the emotion here... Well, she's criticizing those who deny climate change and is highlighting the political aspects of her movement. She seems concerned or upset about the situation. But is it anger? Let me think. The tweet isn't explicitly angry; it's more of a statement. However, given that she's addressing Climate Change denial and using strong terms like "thoughtcrime," there might be underlying frustration.

Wait, but sometimes when people talk about issues they care deeply about, especially in a critical way, it can come off as anger. The mention of being reported for denial could imply that she feels the current state is unacceptable, which might stem from anger or frustration.

Alternatively, maybe it's more about sadness because she's pointing out a problem and hoping for change. But I think the stronger emotion here is more aligned with anger because she's addressing what she perceives as wrongdoings and using strong language to make her point.

So considering all that, I'd say the primary emotion is anger.
