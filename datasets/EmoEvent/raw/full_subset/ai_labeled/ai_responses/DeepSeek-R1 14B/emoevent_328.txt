Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The tweet is just a link with some text: "Photos: Inside Notre Dame After Devastating Fire #NotreDameCathedralFire". 

First, let's break down the components of the tweet. The main words are "photos," "Inside Notre Dame," and "After Devastating Fire." The hashtag also mentions the fire. So, the content is about showing images inside the cathedral after a significant fire event.

Now, considering the context given, I know that the fire at Notre-Dame was a major event that caused widespread sadness and grief. People around the world were affected by this news because it's such an iconic and historically significant building. The tweet is sharing photos of the aftermath, which would likely evoke strong emotions related to loss or devastation.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to determine which one fits best. Since the fire was a tragic event, the primary emotion here is probably sadness. People felt sad because of the destruction and the loss of something valuable. There's no indication of anger or fear in the tweet itself; it's more about conveying the aftermath, which aligns with sadness.

I should also consider if there's any element of surprise. The fire was a sudden event, but the tweet isn't reacting to the news itselfâ€”it's showing photos after the fact. So surprise might not be the primary emotion here. It's more about the emotional response to the destruction, which is sadness.
