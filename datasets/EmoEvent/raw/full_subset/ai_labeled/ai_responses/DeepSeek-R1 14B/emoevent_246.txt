Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Champions League match between Barcelona and Liverpool. The user wrote, "It’s all well and good to have all the ball but Liverpool’s touch in the final third has been poor at best." 

First, let's break down the content. They're talking about Liverpool's performance, specifically their touch in the final third of the field. The phrase "poor at best" suggests that they think Liverpool isn't performing well there. 

The first part says it's "all well and good to have all the ball," which is a bit confusing. Maybe they mean that having possession (the ball) is fine, but then they critique Liverpool's effectiveness in scoring from that position. So overall, the sentiment seems negative towards Liverpool's play.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet isn't expressing any positive emotions like joy or serenity. It's more about criticism of performance, which could be seen as frustration or disappointment. 

Frustration can sometimes fall under anger because it's a form of irritation or annoyance. So in this case, the primary emotion is likely anger because they're expressing dissatisfaction with Liverpool's play.

I don't think it's disgust because that usually relates to something being repulsive, which isn't the case here. Fear would involve anxiety about future events, but the tweet is about current performance. Sadness might be if they were feeling down about the outcome, but again, this seems more frustration than sadness. Surprise would require an unexpected event, which isn't indicated.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed is anger.
