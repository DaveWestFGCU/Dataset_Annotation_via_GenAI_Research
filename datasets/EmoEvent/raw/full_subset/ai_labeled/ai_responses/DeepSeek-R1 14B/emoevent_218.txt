Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says, "Gotta love this kid...... So much better than the doom & gloom #GretaThunberg". Let me break it down.

First, the user starts with "Gotta love this kid", which sounds positive and shows approval or admiration. They're expressing that they like this young person involved in activism. Then they contrast it by saying it's "so much better than the doom & gloom". Doom and gloom usually refer to negative or depressing messages, so the user is comparing Greta Thunberg's message to something more uplifting.

The use of words like "love" and "better" indicates a positive emotion. The overall tone seems approving and maybe even joyful because they're highlighting something positive over what they perceive as negative messages from others. There's no indication of anger, fear, or sadness here; it's more about appreciation and positivity.

So considering the options: anger is out because there's no frustration. Disgust doesn't fit either since they're not showing dislike. Fear isn't present, nor is pensiveness for sadness. The emotion here aligns with joy because of the positive sentiment expressed towards Greta Thunberg's message.
