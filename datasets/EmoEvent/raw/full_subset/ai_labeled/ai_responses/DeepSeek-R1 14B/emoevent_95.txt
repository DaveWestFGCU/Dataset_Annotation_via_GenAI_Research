Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet is about World Book Day, which is an event promoting reading. The author mentions the ocean's beauty and suggests a book about fishes. They also include a review by USER_is_brit and a link.

Looking at the content, it seems positive because they're talking about something beautiful (the ocean) and recommending a book. The use of words like "beauty" and "read" are uplifting. There's no negative language or any signs of distress. Instead, it's encouraging others to engage with literature, which is a joyful activity.

I don't see any elements of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise here. It's all about celebrating books and the ocean, which aligns with joy. So, the emotion should be joy.
