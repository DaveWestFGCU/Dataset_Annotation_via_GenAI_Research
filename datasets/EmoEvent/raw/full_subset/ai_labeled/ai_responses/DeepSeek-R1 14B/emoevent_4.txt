Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says, "I hope Salah scores a hat trick in the second leg! #ChampionsLeague #BARvLIV #LivBar #BARLFC." 

First, let's break down what's being expressed here. The user is talking about hoping that Mohamed Salah, a footballer, will score three goals (a hat trick) in the next match of the Champions League. They're using several hashtags related to the competition and specific teams.

The emotion here seems positive because they're expressing a desire for something good to happenâ€”specifically, their favorite player or team succeeding. When someone hopes for success or achievement, it usually indicates joy or excitement. 

Looking at the mapping guidelines: Joy is associated with emotions like serenity or ecstasy, which can include excitement and happiness. The user isn't showing any negative feelings; instead, they're expressing a positive wish. There's no indication of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise in this tweet.

So, considering all that, the primary emotion here is joy because they're hoping for a successful outcome with enthusiasm.
