Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says, "I still think the #ChampionsLeague theme song is one of the best ever." Let me break this down.

First, the context given is about the UEFA Champions League, which is a well-known football competition. The user is talking about the theme song, specifically mentioning it's one of the best ever. 

The emotion here seems positive because they're praising the song. They use words like "still think" and "one of the best ever," which indicate strong approval or admiration. So, I'm thinking this is a positive emotion.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: joy includes emotions like serenity or ecstasy. The user isn't expressing extreme happiness but rather appreciation, which still falls under joy because it's a positive sentiment without any negative undertones.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise here. It's straightforward praise, so the emotion is likely joy.
