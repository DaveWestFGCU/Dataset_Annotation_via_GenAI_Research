Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is saying that everyone will miss an important piece of history and Christianity while it's being rebuilt, using the hashtag #sosad and linking to a news article.

First, looking at the words used: "missing," "important piece of history and Christianity," and the hashtag "#sosad." These all indicate a sense of loss or sorrow. The author is expressing grief over the destruction of something significant.

The context given mentions that the fire broke out on April 15, 2019, which was a major event. People around the world felt the impact, and many expressed sadness because it wasn't just a building but a symbol with deep historical and cultural significance.

The tweet doesn't show any signs of anger or fear; it's more about the emotional response to losing something valuable. The hashtags reinforce this sentiment, especially "#sosad," which clearly points towards sadness.

So, considering all these factors, the primary emotion here is sadness.
