Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The tweet says: "It’s Women’s History Month! To celebrate the women who have shaped our history, here are 10 inspiring books for a young audience to read!" The user has included several hashtags like #30Seconds, #WomensHistoryMonth, #history, #women, #books, and #WorldBookDay, along with a link.

First, I notice that the tweet is about celebrating Women’s History Month. The author is sharing 10 inspiring books for young readers. The tone seems positive because they're highlighting something educational and uplifting—inspiring books. They’re encouraging others to read and celebrate women's contributions.

Looking at the context provided, it mentions World Book Day as an event promoting reading, which aligns with the hashtags used in the tweet. So the author is tying into both Women’s History Month and World Book Day themes.

The emotions associated with sharing positive content about education, history, and inspiring figures would likely be joy or maybe surprise. But since they're celebrating and promoting something uplifting, it's more about spreading positivity and enthusiasm. That points towards joy because they’re encouraging others to engage in reading and honoring women’s history, which is a happy and motivating message.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise here. The focus is on celebration and inspiration, so the emotion conveyed is joy.
