Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion behind it. The tweet says, "Everyone: No one can kill the Night King! Arya: A girl is no one ðŸ˜‹ #GameOfThrones." 

First, I notice that the tweet references a specific moment from Game of Thrones where Arya Stark kills the Night King. The use of emojis and the wording suggests a reaction to this event.

The phrase "A girl is no one" is a quote from Arya herself, which she says after killing the Night King. This line is significant because it shows her defiance and confidence. The emoji used here is ðŸ˜‹, which is a mischievous or playful smiley face. 

So, putting this together, the author is likely expressing pride or satisfaction in Arya's actions. They're highlighting her strength and cleverness in taking down such a formidable enemy. The playful tone suggests joy rather than any negative emotion.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise here. It's more about celebrating a character's triumph, which aligns with joy.
