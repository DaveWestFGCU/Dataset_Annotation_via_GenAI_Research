Record: "I know it’s been over 24 hours and for some reason that means it’s time for the media to move on, but just to remind you:  An 800 year old building that was a huge beacon of hope for so many people just burned down. #NotreDameCathedralFire #NotreDameFire https://t.co/71YH1mjuWq"

Okay, I need to determine the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is expressing frustration that media attention has moved on after 24 hours, but they're reminding others about the significance of the event. They mention it's an 800-year-old building and a beacon of hope that burned down.

The emotions here seem to be a mix of sadness and maybe some anger. The user is upset that people have moved on quickly, which could indicate frustration or anger. However, the main focus is on the loss of something historically and emotionally significant, which points more towards sadness. They're expressing grief over the destruction of a cherished landmark.

So, considering the guidelines, sadness fits best because they're reflecting on the loss and its impact on many people.
