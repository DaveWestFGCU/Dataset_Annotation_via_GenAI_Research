Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says, "The real question everyone wants to know about last night's #GameofThrones episode. WHERE THE FUCK IS GHOST!?!?!". 

First, let me break down the content. The user is talking about the latest episode and mentions that people are wondering where Ghost is. Ghost is a character in the show, right? So, the tweet is expressing frustration or maybe anger because Ghost's absence is significant enough to be a hot topic.

The use of "WHERE THE FUCK IS GHOST" with multiple exclamation marks and the word "fuck" indicates strong emotion. The phrase "the real question everyone wants to know" suggests that this is a point of contention or confusion among fans, which might be causing some stress or irritation for the tweeter.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: anger includes secondary emotions like annoyance or rage. Here, the language used is quite aggressive and expresses frustration, which aligns with anger. There's no indication of disgust (dislike), fear (apprehension), joy (serenity), sadness (pensiveness), or surprise (amazement). The emotion here seems to be directed at the show's handling of a character, showing irritation.

So, considering all this, the primary emotion is anger.
