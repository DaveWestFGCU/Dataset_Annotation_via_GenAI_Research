Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. Let's break it down.

The tweet says, "#GameofThrones is my forever obsession & guilty pleasure!! ❤️❤️❤️". The user mentions it's their "forever obsession" and a "guilty pleasure," which suggests they really love it but maybe feel a bit sheepish about that love. They also used three heart emojis, which are typically associated with strong positive feelings.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to pick one based on the guidelines provided.

The tweet expresses enthusiasm and affection for Game of Thrones. The words "obsession" and "guilty pleasure" indicate a deep love or passion, which aligns with joy because it's about something they really enjoy and feel strongly about. The heart emojis reinforce that positive emotion.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise here. It's all about their fondness for the show. So, the primary emotion is joy.
