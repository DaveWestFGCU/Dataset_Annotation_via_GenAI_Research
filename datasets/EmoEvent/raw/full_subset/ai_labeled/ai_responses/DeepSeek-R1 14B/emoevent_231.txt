Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. Let's break it down.

The tweet says, "Theon's character has such a great arc, always ran from death until the end. Hero #GameofThrones." 

First, the user is talking about Theon's character arc. They mention that he "always ran from death until the end" and calls him a "Hero." So, they're highlighting Theon's journey and his actions throughout the series.

The word "great" in "great arc" suggests a positive sentiment. Using "ran from death until the end" indicates that Theon had a significant and perhaps dramatic storyline where he faced death multiple times. The use of "always" emphasizes consistency in his character development, which might be seen as commendable or impressive.

Calling him a "Hero" is clearly a compliment, indicating admiration or respect for Theon's character. This term carries a strong positive connotation, showing that the user holds Theon in high regard.

Putting it all together, the tweet expresses pride and approval regarding Theon's development. The emotions here are likely joy because the user seems to be celebrating Theon's journey and his role as a hero. There's no indication of negative emotions like anger or sadness; instead, it's all positive reinforcement.
