Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The user is talking about watching two things: Game of Thrones (GOT) and Avengers Endgame. They mention it's a first-time matinee for Endgame, which probably means they're excited or maybe nostalgic. 

The tweet says, "GOT 2x last night and a first time matinee of Endgame this after... Anybody got a hug they can spare? #shook #gameofthrones #avengersendgame." The hashtags include "#shook," which I think is slang for being scared or shocked. 

So the user watched two movies, maybe back-to-back, and feels so moved that they're asking for a hug. The word "shook" suggests they were emotionally affected, possibly feeling fear or surprise from the content. Since both GOT and Endgame are known for their intense storylines and emotional moments, it's likely the user felt something strong.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: if it's similar to distraction or amazement, classify as surprise. But "shook" can also imply fear or anxiety. However, since they're asking for a hug after watching these movies, which are both epic and have emotional climaxes, maybe they're feeling overwhelmed with emotions but not necessarily scared.

Wait, the primary emotion here is probably surprise because of the use of "#shook," which often conveys being surprised or shocked by something. Alternatively, it could be fear if they felt anxious after watching intense scenes. But considering the context and the request for a hug, it might lean more towards surprise due to the emotional impact.

I think the emotion here is surprise because "shook" indicates being surprised or amazed by what they watched.
