Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user mentions watching episode 3 and thanking someone for the music, specifically praising the Night King's soundtrack with a heart emoji.

First, let me break down the components. They express gratitude towards USER_Ramin, which suggests appreciation or satisfaction. The use of "amazing piece of music" indicates they enjoyed it. Also, the heart emoji adds an emotional touch, likely showing love or affection.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger is out because there's no sign of irritation. Disgust doesn't fit as there's nothing negative mentioned. Fear isn't present either; the tone is positive. Joy seems to align with their appreciation and enjoyment. Sadness isn't applicable here since they're expressing positive feelings. Surprise could be a contender if something unexpected happened, but it's more about praise.

The heart emoji reinforces positive emotions, so joy makes sense because they're showing love for the music and gratitude towards the composer.
