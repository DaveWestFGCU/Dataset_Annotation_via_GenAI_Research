Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says that Messi won his first title as captain and became the first Barcelona player to win 10 La Liga titles. Hmm, that sounds like a big achievement for him.

I remember from the guidelines that if the emotion is similar to serenity or ecstasy, it's joy. So, winning a championship would probably make someone feel really happy or joyful. There's no negative language here; it's all about celebration and success.

Looking at the other options: anger doesn't fit because there's nothing upsetting. Disgust isn't applicable either since it's not about dislike. Fear? No, this is a positive event. Sadness? Definitely not, as it's a happy moment. Surprise could be possible if something unexpected happened, but winning a title after being captain isn't really surprising in the context of Messi's career.

So yeah, the emotion here is joy because it's about celebrating an achievement.
