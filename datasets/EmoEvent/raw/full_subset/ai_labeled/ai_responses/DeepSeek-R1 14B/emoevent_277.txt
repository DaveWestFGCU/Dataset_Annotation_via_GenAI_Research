Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user is talking about all the carnage and great characters dying during an episode. They mention that if Cersai ends up on the Iron Throne, they'll be royally pissed off. 

First, let's break down the words used. "Carnage" suggests a lot of violence or destruction, which can evoke strong emotions. The user is clearly upset about the deaths of characters they care about. They express frustration with Cersai possibly getting the throne despite all the bloodshed.

The phrase "pissed off" is a common slang term for anger. So that's a direct indicator. Also, using words like "royally pissed off" emphasizes their level of anger. There's no indication of other emotions like fear or sadness here; it's more about being annoyed and upset with the outcome.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: if the emotion is similar to annoyance or rage, it's classified as anger. Since the tweet expresses frustration and strong dislike towards the situation, that fits under anger.
