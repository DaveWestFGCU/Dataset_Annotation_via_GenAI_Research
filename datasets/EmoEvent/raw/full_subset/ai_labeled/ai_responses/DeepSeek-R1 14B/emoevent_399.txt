Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. Let me read it again: "Book lover? From beach libraries and charming literary cafés, to award-winning authors, all you have to do is pick up a book, sit back, and relax: Israel's got you covered. Happy World Book Day! #Israel #WorldBookDay #books USER #book (via our friends at USER) https://t.co/T4Qrd6jdcJ"

Hmm, the tweet starts by addressing book lovers, which is positive. It mentions various appealing places like beach libraries and literary cafés, which sounds inviting. Then it talks about award-winning authors, which adds to the excitement. The message encourages picking up a book, sitting back, and relaxing—words that convey calmness and enjoyment.

The overall tone seems cheerful and celebratory. They're promoting reading and literature in Israel, so they must be happy about this event. The use of "Happy World Book Day!" is a direct expression of joy. Also, the hashtags are positive and related to books and celebration.

I don't see any negative words or emotions here. It's all about celebrating books and encouraging people to enjoy reading. So the primary emotion is definitely joy.
