Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet by Greta Thunberg. Let me read it again: "Oh yes it will, disappointingly, as have all of the other injustices against the Catalan government and people. Nothing will happen until the EU practices what it preaches." She's talking about disappointment with how the EU is handling things, similar to other injustices.

The word "disappointingly" stands out here. That clearly indicates a feeling of being let down or unhappy. So, that points towards sadness because she's expressing a sense of sorrow or dissatisfaction over the situation. There's no indication of anger or frustration beyond the disappointment, which is more aligned with sadness rather than something like fear or surprise.

I don't see any elements suggesting joy, fear, disgust, or surprise. It's all about the negative outcome and her feelings of letdown. So, I think the emotion here is sadness.
