Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet is from Greta Thunberg, who's known for her climate activism and Fridays for Future movement. The text says: "Educating for Extinction. (climate change as a catalyst for shifts in a failing system)" with several hashtags related to climate issues.

First, I'll break down the content. The phrase "Educating for Extinction" sounds pretty intense. It suggests that current educational practices might be leading towards extinction, possibly implying that things are getting worse or that there's a lack of effective action. The mention of climate change as a catalyst for shifts in a failing system adds to the sense that the systems in place aren't handling the situation well.

Now, considering the emotions associated with each label: anger is about annoyance or rage; disgust is more about dislike or disinterest; fear involves apprehension or anxiety; joy is serenity or ecstasy; sadness is pensiveness or grief; surprise is distraction or amazement.

Looking at Greta's message, she's highlighting a critical issue—climate change—and the failure of systems to address it. This seems more like frustration rather than pure anger. But according to the guidelines, if it's similar to annoyance or rage, we classify it as anger. Alternatively, maybe it's sadness because she's pointing out a failing system that could lead to extinction.

Wait, but "Educating for Extinction" sounds more like a critique of current practices leading to negative outcomes, which might be frustration or anger. However, the overall tone doesn't seem to express pure anger; instead, it's more about highlighting a problem and its severity, which could lean towards sadness because it's a serious issue causing concern.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider the context of her activism. Greta often speaks out against systemic failures, which can evoke feelings of frustration or anger. However, in this tweet, she's more focused on the educational aspect and how it relates to climate change. It might be more about sadness because she's pointing out that education isn't addressing the real issues, leading to potential extinction.

Alternatively, maybe it's fear because talking about shifts in a failing system could imply anxiety about the future. But I think the primary emotion here is more about the gravity of the situation and the failure of systems, which might lean towards sadness or perhaps anger.

Wait, but the tweet isn't explicitly expressing an emotion; it's more of a statement. According to the guidelines, if there's no expressed emotion, we still have to choose one from the list. So maybe I should look for implied emotions. The hashtags include #ExtinctionRebellion and #climatestrike, which are terms associated with activism driven by concern and urgency.

Considering all this, I think the primary emotion here is sadness because it's about a failing system leading towards extinction, which is a heavy and somber topic.
