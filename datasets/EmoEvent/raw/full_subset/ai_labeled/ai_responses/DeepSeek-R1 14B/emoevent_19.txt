Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says, "Looking for a way to relax? Curl up with a good book! #WorldBookDay" and includes a link.

First, let's break down the content. The author is suggesting relaxation by reading a good book. The use of words like "curl up" and "good book" gives a sense of comfort and calmness. They're promoting reading as a way to relax, which ties into World Book Day's theme of promoting reading.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: joy includes emotions like serenity or ecstasy. Here, the author is expressing a positive feeling associated with relaxation and reading, which aligns with joy. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or sadness. The tone is uplifting and encouraging.

So, considering all this, the primary emotion conveyed is joy.
