Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is using some hashtags like #Luxy and emojis such as ⛪️❤️💏. Let me break it down.

First, the context is the tragic event of the fire at Notre-Dame on April 15, 2019. That's a sad and alarming situation for many people around the world. Now, looking at the tweet: "How #Luxy lowers the pain of #NotreDame 👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼 ⛪️❤️💏". The user is talking about using #Luxy to lower the pain caused by the fire at Notre-Dame.

I'm not exactly sure what #Luxy refers to here. Maybe it's a typo or another hashtag? But regardless, the main point seems to be about coping with the pain of the event. The emojis used are a church symbol ( Episcopal?), a heart, and a couple emoji. So maybe they're trying to express something positive or comforting in response to the tragedy.

The hashtags also include #DatingAround, #DatingInRealLife, etc., which suggests that perhaps the tweet is about using dating apps as a way to cope with the sadness of the fire. The overall tone seems hopeful or at least trying to find a silver lining amidst the disaster.

So considering the emotions: the primary emotion here isn't sadness because they're talking about lowering the pain, which implies moving past it. It's more about finding comfort or joy in something else despite the tragedy. Therefore, the emotion conveyed is likely joy because they're highlighting a positive way to deal with the negative event.
