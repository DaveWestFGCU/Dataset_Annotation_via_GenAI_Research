Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. The user is talking about someone funding a personal attack for two years without results and then asking if they'll pay back taxpayers. They end with "Resign you dolt." 

Hmm, the language here seems pretty harsh. Words like "dolt" are definitely derogatory. The tone is confrontational and critical. They're not just stating facts but clearly expressing frustration or irritation towards someone in power.

Looking at the mapping guidelines, secondary emotions similar to annoyance or rage fall under anger. This tweet doesn't seem to express fear, joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise. It's more about the user being upset with the situation and the person they're addressing.

So, putting it all together, the emotion here is likely anger because of the strong, confrontational language used.
