Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet starts with "Wawww," which seems like an expression of surprise or maybe excitement. The user mentions being impressed for the first time that Fox News is taking responsibility towards liars and conspirators. They're talking about a French elected official's interview related to conspiracy theories. 

So, breaking this down: The event is the Notre Dame fire, but the tweet isn't directly about the tragedy itself. Instead, it's reacting to Fox News handling something else—maybe how they covered the story or an interview. The user expresses surprise that Fox News is taking responsibility in a way they hadn't seen before.

The word "impressed" here could be positive, but given the context of conspiracy theories and elected officials, it might not be entirely positive. However, the primary emotion seems to be surprise because the user is highlighting something unexpected or unusual about Fox News' approach. They're pointing out an unreal interview, which adds to the element of surprise.

I don't see any strong indicators of anger, disgust, fear, or sadness here. The focus is more on the unexpectedness of Fox News' actions rather than a negative emotion towards the event itself.
