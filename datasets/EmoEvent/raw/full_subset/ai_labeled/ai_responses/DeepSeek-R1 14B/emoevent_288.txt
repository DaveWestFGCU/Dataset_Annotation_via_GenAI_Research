Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. Let me read it again: "The storytelling, the characters, the filming, the directing, the acting, the sets, the lights, the music... Perfect beyond comparison. #GameofThrones 4ever." 

Hmm, the user is listing various aspects of the show and using superlatives like "perfect beyond comparison." They also mention it's "4ever," which shows a lasting appreciation. The words used are all positive, highlighting different elements that contribute to their enjoyment.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Since the tweet is expressing high praise and satisfaction, the emotion here seems to be joy. They're clearly happy and impressed with the show's various aspects. There's no indication of any negative emotions or surprise; it's purely a positive sentiment.

So, I think the primary emotion is joy.
