Okay, I need to determine the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user mentions that images of the cathedral burning are heart-breaking and describes watching the French mourn in song as sad yet beautiful, like a hopeful prayer. These expressions clearly indicate feelings of sadness and empathy for the loss.
