Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The user is asking others to share their favorite books and mentions they'd like to read them. This sounds positive because they're expressing enthusiasm for reading and connecting with other book lovers. They seem happy and excited to discover new books. There's no negative language here, so it's not anger, disgust, fear, or sadness. It's definitely not surprise either. The emotion is more about joy because of the eagerness and love for books.
