Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Spanish election. Let me read it again: "#SpainElection The Left trounces the Right. Well done Spain https://t.co/MBSnwSfiSH". 

The user is talking about the left winning over the right and then saying "Well done Spain." That sounds positive, like they're approving of the outcome. So the emotion here seems to be joy because they're celebrating a victory for their side.

I don't see any signs of anger or disgust; it's more about approval. Fear doesn't fit because there's no indication of worry. Sadness isn't present either since they're expressing satisfaction. Surprise might come into play if the outcome was unexpected, but "trounces" suggests it wasn't a close call, so maybe not surprise. 

So yeah, joy seems to be the right classification here.
