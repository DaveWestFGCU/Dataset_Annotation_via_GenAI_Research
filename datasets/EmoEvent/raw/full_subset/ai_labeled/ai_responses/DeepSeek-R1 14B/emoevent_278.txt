Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The user is sharing a dance track they made to support climate action and mentions Greta Thunberg and related hashtags. They're encouraging others to play it loud. The language used is positive and enthusiasticâ€”words like "great message," "voice of USER," "play it loud." There's no negative or sad tone here. It seems more about excitement and support, which aligns with joy.
