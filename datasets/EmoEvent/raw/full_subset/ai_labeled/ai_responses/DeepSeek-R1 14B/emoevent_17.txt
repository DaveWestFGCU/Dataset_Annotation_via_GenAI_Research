Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user wrote, "THAT EPISODE WAS FUCKING EVERYTHING... ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ #GameofThrones SHAKING. ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±". 

First, looking at the words used: "fucking everything" is a strong negative expression, which might indicate anger or frustration. The emojis are ðŸ¤¯ and ðŸ˜±, both of which I recognize as expressions of shock or surprise. The word "SHAKING" also suggests being surprised or amazed.

The tweet seems to express a reaction to an episode that was unexpected or shocking. The use of multiple exclamation marks and emojis emphasizes the intensity of the emotion. While there's frustration ("fucking everything"), the primary feeling conveyed through the emojis and the word "SHAKING" is more about surprise or amazement.

So, considering the guidelines, if the emotion is similar to distraction or amazement, it should be classified as surprise. Even though there's some frustration, the overwhelming emotion here seems to be surprise due to the shock value of the episode.
