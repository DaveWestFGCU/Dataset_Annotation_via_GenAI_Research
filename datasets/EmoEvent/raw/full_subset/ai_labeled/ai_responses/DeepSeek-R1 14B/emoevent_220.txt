Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Messi. Let me read it again: "Messi.....what can you say? The man is a legend. That free kick....he’s taking the p*ss....jaw dropping... 😮 🐐#Messi #BARLIV #ChampionsLeague"

Alright, breaking it down. The user starts by calling Messi a legend, which sounds like admiration or awe. Then they mention a "free kick" and say he's "taking the p*ss," which I think is slang for messing around or being playful. They also use emojis: 😮 which is shock or surprise, and 🐐 which might be a reference to something else but could add to the tone.

The hashtags are #Messi, #BARLIV (which I think stands for Barcelona vs Liverpool), and #ChampionsLeague, so it's definitely about a football match. Messi scoring an amazing free kick would naturally cause surprise because it's unexpected and impressive.

So putting it all together: The user is expressing amazement at Messi's skill, using emojis that convey shock, and the context of a big competition like the Champions League adds to the excitement. There's no negative emotion here; it's purely about being surprised by something incredible happening in the game.
