Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is talking about feeling uncomfortable over the amount of money pledged for restoration within 24 hours and contrasts that with helping people. They end with a sad emoji ðŸ˜¢.

First, let's break down the content. The author expresses discomfort regarding the funds raised for the cathedral quickly but points out that the same can't be said for aiding people. This comparison suggests they're upset or disappointed about the situation.

The emotions listed are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The sad emoji is a strong indicator of sadness. But I should also consider the context. The tweet isn't just expressing personal loss but rather frustration with societal priorities. However, the primary emotion here seems to be sadness because they're reflecting on the disparity and feeling down about it.

I don't think it's anger because while there might be frustration, the main emotion is more about sorrow or disappointment. Disgust could be a possibility if they were expressing dislike, but the sad emoji points more towards sadness.
