Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet says: "Don't be a fucking idiot! The world needs your support, udumass! Don't be a fucking idiot! The world needs your support, udumass!" There are also some hashtags at the end related to climate change and Greta Thunberg's movement.

First, I notice that the author is using strong language like "fucking idiot" and "udumass," which seems pretty harsh. That makes me think of anger because those words are clearly meant to express frustration or irritation. The repetition of "Don't be a fucking idiot!" emphasizes their strong feelings.

The message also calls out for support, but the way it's phrased is more confrontational rather than pleading. It feels like the author is scolding or reprimanding someone for not supporting the cause, which again points towards anger.

Looking at the context provided, Greta Thunberg is known for her passionate and sometimes intense advocacy against climate change. Her movement involves striking every Friday to push governments to act. The tweet seems to align with that activism but takes a more aggressive tone.

I should consider if there's any other emotion here. There's no obvious sign of fear or sadness; it's more about urging action with strong language. Disgust could be possible, but the primary emotion here feels more like anger because of the direct criticism and harsh words used.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet is anger.
