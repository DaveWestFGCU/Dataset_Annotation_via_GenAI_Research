Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The user wrote, "#BarcaLiverpool Barca are just better today. That's it. #Messi #goaloftheweek #ChampionsLeague." 

First, let me break down the content. They're talking about Barcelona (Barca) being better than Liverpool in a match, probably from the Champions League since that's one of the hashtags. The user mentions Messi and the goal of the week, which are positive things related to Barca.

The emotion here seems to be positive because they're highlighting their team's performance with excitement. They used "just better" and emphasized it by saying "That's it," which might indicate a strong affirmation or pride in their team's success.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: joy is associated with serenity or ecstasy, but more relevantly here, it's about positive feelings towards something good happening. The user isn't expressing any negative emotions like anger or sadness; instead, they're celebrating a win or a great performance.

So, considering all this, the emotion conveyed is joy.
