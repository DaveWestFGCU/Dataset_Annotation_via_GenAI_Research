Record: "Socialism in practice folks. Socialism gives too much power and authority to the state and #Venezuela is yet another example of a bloated government tyrannising it's own citizens. #Venezuelan citizens have suffered too much under this regime and it must end! https://t.co/vOhJUP4HEZ"

Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Venezuela's political situation. The user is talking about socialism giving too much power to the state and mentions that Venezuela's government is tyrannizing its citizens. They also express that the citizens have suffered a lot and say it must end.

First, looking at the language used: words like "tyrannising," "suffered too much," and "must end" all carry strong negative connotations. The author seems frustrated or upset about the situation. Now, considering the emotion categories, I need to decide between anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

The tweet isn't expressing fear or anxiety; it's more about the current state of affairs and a desire for change. It doesn't seem like joy either because the tone is clearly negative. Sadness might be possible if focusing on the suffering, but the stronger emotion here seems to be frustration or irritation, which falls under anger.

So, I think the primary emotion here is anger because the author is expressing strong disapproval and a desire for an end to what they perceive as oppressive rule.
