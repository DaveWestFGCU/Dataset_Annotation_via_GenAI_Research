Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet for World Book Day. The tweet says "Happy #WorldBookDay!" and mentions a blog post where staff share their favorite human rights books. It also asks if my favorite book made the list and includes links.

First, the word "Happy" right at the beginning is a strong indicator. That's joy. But I should check the rest of the tweet to see if there's any other emotion present. The tone seems positive throughoutâ€”celebrating books and sharing favorites. No negative words or signs of other emotions like anger or sadness.

The use of emojis isn't mentioned, but the exclamation mark adds to the celebratory feel. The links are probably just for more information, not expressing any emotion themselves. So overall, the primary emotion is joy because they're celebrating World Book Day and sharing book recommendations in a positive way.
