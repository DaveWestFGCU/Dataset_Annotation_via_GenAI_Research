Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let me read it again: "USER_Medieval loved your story on construction guys. People that mostly love what they do when a job well done. The best day is when the job is done and everyone has all there fingers and toes. Out of sight but not out of mind. #NotreDameCathedralFire"

Hmm, the user is talking about construction workers who love their jobs, especially when things go well. They mention that the best day is when the job is done safely, with everyone having all their fingers and toes. So there's a focus on safety and completion.

The tweet also ends with "Out of sight but not out of mind," which might mean that even though they're no longer working on the project, it's still in their thoughts. But considering the context is about the Notre Dame fire, I wonder if there's an underlying emotion related to that event.

Wait, the user is expressing pride and satisfaction in a job well done, especially when everyone is safe. That sounds positive, so maybe joy? They're highlighting the good feelings from completing a task successfully without any mishaps. There's no negative emotion here; it's all about positivity and safety.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, or surprise. It's more about celebrating a successful completion, which aligns with joy.
