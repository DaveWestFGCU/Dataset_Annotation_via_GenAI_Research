Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet is about Messi and Barcelona winning the La Liga title again and taking a step towards achieving the 'Treble'. They're using hashtags like #Barca, #LaLiga Champions, and others which show excitement.

The author is clearly happy because they mention conquering the title and moving towards a significant achievement in football. The use of words like "conquer" and "achieve the Treble" suggests a sense of victory and success. Also, the emojis and hashtags are positive indicators of joy.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise here. It's all about celebrating their win and the upcoming achievements. So, the emotion conveyed is definitely joy.
