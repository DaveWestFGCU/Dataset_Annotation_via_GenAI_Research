Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The tweet says: "Wow! Nearly a billion dollars overnight!?!? ðŸ˜³ #NotreDameCathedralFire #NotreDame https://t.co/BmzCIFHPh8". 

First, I'll break down the components of the tweet. The user starts with "Wow!", which immediately suggests surprise or astonishment. Then they mention "nearly a billion dollars overnight," which probably refers to the amount of money raised for the cathedral's reconstruction after the fire. The use of multiple exclamation marks and question marks emphasizes their shock.

The emoji used is ðŸ˜³, which is a face with raised eyebrows and a smirk. This emoji typically conveys surprise or disbelief, sometimes mixed with humor or sarcasm. Given the context of the tweet, it seems like the user is surprised by how quickly such a large sum was raised, possibly questioning the suddenness or the amount.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: if the emotion is similar to distraction or amazement, we classify it as surprise. The tweet doesn't express anger, disgust, fear, joy, or sadness. It's more about being amazed by the rapid fundraising efforts after such a significant event.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion here is surprise.
