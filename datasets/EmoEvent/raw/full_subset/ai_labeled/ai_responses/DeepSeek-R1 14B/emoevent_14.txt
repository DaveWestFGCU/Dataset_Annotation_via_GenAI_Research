Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Venezuela's crisis. The user is talking about socialism destroying everything and mentions that Maduro is killing his own people. They also use some strong language like "Do you still want to deny" which sounds frustrated or angry. The hashtags like #threestooges suggest they're calling others names, showing irritation. The overall tone seems intense and filled with rage against the government's actions. So, I think the emotion here is anger.
