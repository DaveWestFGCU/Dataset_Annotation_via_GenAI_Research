Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. The user is addressing someone as a "tyrant" and mentions Marxist ideology bringing misery and death. They're calling for freedom and using hashtags like #venezuelalibre and #socialismkills. There's also a mention of South African politics with #VoteCOPE.

The language here is pretty strong. Words like "tyrant," "misery," "death," and "failed" indicate frustration and anger towards the current regime. The user is urging others to wake up, which suggests urgency and impatience. They're not just stating facts but expressing a strong emotional reaction against the policies and leadership.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: if it's similar to annoyance or rage, it's anger. This tweet definitely fits that category because of the harsh words and the call to action against what the user perceives as oppressive ideologies.
