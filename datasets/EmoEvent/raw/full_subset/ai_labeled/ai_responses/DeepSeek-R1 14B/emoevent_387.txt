Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about World Book Day. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet says: "This #WorldBookDay, give the gift of reading. Today, with every book you buy at [link], you'll be making one new ebook available to readers in our programs. Thank you for spreading the joy of reading far and wide! USER #WBD2019 [another link]"

Hmm, the tweet is encouraging people to buy books and mentions that each purchase helps make an ebook available. The language used here is positive and uplifting. Words like "gift," "reading," "joy," and "spreading" all have a happy connotation.

The author seems to be promoting reading and sharing the love for books, which suggests they're feeling joyful about it. There's no negative or neutral tone; instead, it's all about celebration and spreading happiness.

Looking at the mapping guidelines, joy is associated with emotions like serenity or ecstasy. While this isn't ecstatic, the overall message is definitely positive and meant to inspire a sense of happiness and fulfillment.

So, considering all that, the primary emotion here is joy.
