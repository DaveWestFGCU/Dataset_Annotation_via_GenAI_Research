Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet is: "VVD ball watching again ðŸ˜‚ you love to see it #ChampionsLeague". 

First, let's break down the components of the tweet. VVD likely refers to Virgil van Dijk, a footballer known for his skills and presence in matches. The phrase "ball watching" might be a playful way to describe him being focused on the ball or perhaps being dominant in defense.

The user added ðŸ˜‚ which is a laughing emoji, indicating that they're finding something amusing. They also mention "you love to see it", which suggests they enjoy seeing VVD perform in this way. The hashtag #ChampionsLeague adds context about the competition they're referring to.

So, putting it together, the tweet seems to be expressing enjoyment or amusement related to VVD's performance in the Champions League. The laughing emoji and the phrase "you love to see it" both point towards a positive emotion. 

Looking at the mapping guidelines, joy is associated with emotions like serenity or ecstasy, which are more intense forms of happiness. However, amusement and enjoyment also fall under the umbrella of joy. There's no indication of any negative emotions hereâ€”anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise aren't present.

Therefore, the primary emotion here is joy because the tweet conveys a sense of pleasure and amusement related to VVD's actions in the Champions League.
