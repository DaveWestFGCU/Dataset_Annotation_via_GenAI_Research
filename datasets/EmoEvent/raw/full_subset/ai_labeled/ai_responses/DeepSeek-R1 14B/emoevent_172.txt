Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let me read through it carefully.

The tweet starts with "🐐🐐🐐", which is a symbol often used to denote goats or excellence, sometimes as an emoji for greatness. Then it says, "It's official. Lionel Messi IS NOT HUMAN." That sounds like a compliment, expressing that Messi is extraordinary or superhuman in his skills.

Next part: "An inch-perfect free kick from the USER icon makes it 3-0!" So they're talking about a precise free kick by Messi, which resulted in a goal, making the score 3-0. The hashtags are #BARLIV and #ChampionsLeague, indicating it's related to a live match between Barcelona and another team, likely Juventus, given the context of the Champions League.

The link at the end is for following the live coverage. So putting this together, the tweet is about Messi scoring an amazing goal in a Champions League match, which is being celebrated by the author.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: joy includes serenity or ecstasy. The tone here seems very positive and excited. They're praising Messi's skill and celebrating the goal. There's no negative language; instead, it's all about admiration and excitement.

So the primary emotion conveyed is joy.
