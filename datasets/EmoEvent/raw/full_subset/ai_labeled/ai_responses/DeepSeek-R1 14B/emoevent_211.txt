Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion behind it. The user wrote, "Not my daughter you bitch. A mother can be a fighter too moly proved it." They also included some hashtags related to World Book Day and Harry Potter.

First, looking at the language used: "you bitch" is clearly an insult, which indicates anger or frustration. The phrase "Not my daughter" suggests someone is trying to protect their child, which could be out of fear or concern, but combined with the insult, it leans more towards anger.

The second part says, "A mother can be a fighter too moly proved it." There's a typo here, probably meant to say "moly" as "my" or maybe another word. Regardless, the sentiment is about being strong and protective, which again ties into feelings of anger when someone feels they need to defend their child.

The hashtags are related to World Book Day and Harry Potter, but those don't add much in terms of emotionâ€”they're just topics. The overall tone from the tweet seems confrontational and aggressive, so I'm leaning towards anger as the primary emotion.
