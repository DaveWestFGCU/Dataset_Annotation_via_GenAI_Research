Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The tweet says, "#WorldBookDay ðŸ“šðŸ˜Š Happy Book Day! A good read can change your day! ðŸ’¯ðŸ”† [link]". 

First, let's break down the components of the tweet. The user is using a smiley face emoji (ðŸ˜Š) which usually indicates happiness or joy. They're also using other positive emojis like ðŸ’¯ and ðŸ”†, which are often associated with celebration or positivity. The text itself expresses excitement about World Book Day and mentions that a good read can change your day for the better.

Looking at the context provided, it's an event promoted by UNESCO to encourage reading, so the sentiment is likely positive. The emojis used reinforce this positive feeling. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or sadness here. Instead, everything points towards joy and positivity.

According to the mapping guidelines, if the emotion is similar to serenity or ecstasy, it should be classified as joy. Since the tweet is expressing happiness and excitement, "joy" seems to fit perfectly.
