Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion. The user mentions having a long-standing fear of zombies, which they joke about with a smiley face. Then, after watching an episode of Game of Thrones, they express that they won't be turning off their lights for the next 24 years. This seems like a reaction to something scary or intense in the show. The mention of not sleeping because of fear fits into the category of fear. Even though there's humor involved, the underlying emotion is fear.
