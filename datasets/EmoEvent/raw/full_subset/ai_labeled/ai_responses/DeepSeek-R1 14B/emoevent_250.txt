Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says, "Throw your favourite books at people you hate with full force #WorldBookDay." Hmm, let's break it down.

First, World Book Day is about promoting reading and books, which is usually a positive thing. But the tweet suggests throwing favorite books at people one hates. That sounds more like an aggressive action rather than something happy or neutral.

The phrase "throw your favourite books" might seem playful at first glance, but when combined with "at people you hate," it takes on a different tone. Throwing things can be seen as a way to express anger or frustration. The use of "full force" also adds intensity, which reinforces the idea that this isn't just a simple gesture.

I'm thinking about the emotions listed: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. This doesn't seem like joy because throwing books at people you hate isn't a happy action. It's not fear or surprise either; those would involve more shock or anxiety. Disgust could be possible if it's about disliking something, but the action here is more aggressive.

So, considering all that, the emotion seems to be anger. The tweet is suggesting an angry or annoyed reaction towards people one hates by using books as projectiles.
