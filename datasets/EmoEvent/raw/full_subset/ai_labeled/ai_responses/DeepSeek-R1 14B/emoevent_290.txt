Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The user is comparing "Avengers Endgame" and the Battle of Winterfell from Game of Thrones. They say "'Endgame' was great...but I mean...Arya." 

Hmm, the mention of Arya makes me think they're highlighting her role in the GoT battle. But the way it's phrased is a bit vague. The user seems to be expressing that while Endgame was good, their focus or preference lies with Arya's part in Winterfell.

I'm trying to map this to one of the emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. It doesn't seem like they're angry or fearful. They don't express dislike either, so maybe not disgust. There's no obvious sign of joy or sadness here. 

Wait, could it be surprise? The tweet is comparing two big events, but I'm not sure if that's a surprising statement. Alternatively, maybe the user is expressing a preference, which might lean towards joy because they're talking about something they care aboutâ€”Arya.

But another angle: sometimes when people mention specific characters or moments, it can show affection or nostalgia, which could be linked to joy. However, the tweet isn't explicitly positive; it's more of a comparison. 

Alternatively, maybe there's no strong emotion here, but according to the guidelines, I have to choose one from the list. Since they're expressing a preference for Arya's part, perhaps that leans towards joy because they seem to value her role positively.

Wait, but the tweet is neutral in tone. It doesn't use exclamation marks or positive adjectives. So maybe it's not joy. Alternatively, could it be surprise? Maybe the user is surprised by how much they felt about Arya's part compared to Endgame.

I'm a bit torn here. The primary emotion might actually be none of these, but I have to choose. Since they're highlighting Arya in a positive light, maybe joy is the closest fit.
