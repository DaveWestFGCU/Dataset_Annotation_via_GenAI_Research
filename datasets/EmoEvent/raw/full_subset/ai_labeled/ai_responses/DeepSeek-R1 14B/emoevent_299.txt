Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is talking about the 10th church being vandalized and says "Why can’t people just chill? Fuck..." They also used some hashtags related to the event.

First, looking at the words they used: "vandalized," "chill," and "fuck." Vandalizing churches suggests anger or frustration. The use of profanity ("fuck") definitely adds to that feeling. So I'm thinking it's more than just sadness; it's stronger.

The context is a series of church vandalisms, which might be making the author upset because they see a pattern. They're frustrated with people's actions and maybe even shocked or surprised by how many incidents have happened. But the primary emotion seems to be frustration or anger directed at the vandals' behavior.

So considering the options: anger fits because of the frustration and use of strong language. Disgust could also be possible, but I think it's more about being annoyed or upset rather than feeling disgusted. Fear isn't really there unless they're worried about more incidents, but that's not the main emotion here. Joy and surprise don't fit at all. Sadness might come into play with the destruction, but the stronger emotion is anger.

Therefore, I'll classify this as anger.
