Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The user wrote, "USER Have I mentioned how much I love you? YOU ROCK, George Takei!! Keep telling it like it is! #TRUMP #NotreDameCathedralFire #HeDoesntSpeakForMe." 

First, looking at the content, they're expressing love and admiration towards someone named George Takei. The words "love" and "rock" are positive and show affection or joy. They also encourage George to keep speaking his mind, which suggests agreement or support.

Now, considering the hashtags: #TRUMP, #NotreDameCathedralFire, and #HeDoesntSpeakForMe. The Notre Dame fire is a tragic event, but the tweet doesn't seem to focus on that. Instead, it's more about expressing love towards George Takei and possibly supporting Trump or opposing someone who speaks for others.

The primary emotion here seems to be joy because of the affectionate language used. There's no indication of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise in the message. The user is clearly happy and supportive.
