Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet is about World Book Day and suggests some books to read. The author is promoting books from a user and providing specific titles with links.

First, looking at the language used: "That's what I hear!" seems excited or enthusiastic. They're encouraging others to pick up books and are offering suggestions. The use of emojis like the book might indicate positivity. The tone doesn't show any negative emotions; instead, it's more about sharing and excitement.

Considering the mapping guidelines, joy is associated with serenity or ecstasy. While this isn't overly ecstatic, the enthusiasm in promoting books could be seen as a positive emotion. There's no sign of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise here. The author seems happy to share book recommendations, which aligns with joy.

So, I think the primary emotion is joy because they're sharing something they enjoy and encouraging others to do so in a positive way.
