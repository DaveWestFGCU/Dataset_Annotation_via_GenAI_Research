Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Venezuela's situation. The tweet says, "#Venezuela stop sending our troops to die in other people's wars." 

First, let me break down what's being expressed here. The author is addressing Venezuela and asking them to stop sending their troops to die in "other peoples' wars." This suggests that the author is concerned about the involvement of Venezuelan troops in conflicts that aren't necessarily their own.

Now, considering the context provided earlier, there's a crisis regarding who is the legitimate presidentâ€”Nicolas Maduro or Juan Guaido. The country is divided, and so is the world. So, this tweet might be coming from someone who supports one side over the other, possibly Juan Guaido since he's recognized by some countries.

The emotion here seems to be a call for action, but more importantly, it's expressing a concern or worry about the troops' safety and involvement in foreign conflicts. The author is likely upset or worried about the situation, which could relate to fear or sadness.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: If the tweet conveys secondary emotions like pensiveness or grief, classify as sadness. Alternatively, if it's about apprehension or anxiety, it would be fear. 

The tweet doesn't explicitly express anger or joy; it's more of a plea. The author is worried about the troops dying in other people's wars, which could stem from fear for their safety or sadness over the loss and the situation's impact.

I think the primary emotion here is fear because the author is expressing concern about the troops' involvement in dangerous situations that aren't their own. It's a sense of apprehension or anxiety about what might happen to them.
