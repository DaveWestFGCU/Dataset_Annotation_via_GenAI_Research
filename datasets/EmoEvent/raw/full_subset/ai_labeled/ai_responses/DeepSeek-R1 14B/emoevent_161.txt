Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The user provided a link and mentions celebrating the joy of reading. They also highlight that reading is fun and good for the brain. The hashtags are all related to books and reading.

First, looking at the content, the main words used are "joy," "fun," and positive aspects of reading. The tone seems uplifting and encouraging. There's no negative language or any signs of distress or surprise. It's more about promoting something they love.

The guidelines say that if the emotion is similar to serenity or ecstasy, it should be classified as joy. Since the tweet expresses happiness and enthusiasm about reading, "joy" fits perfectly here.
