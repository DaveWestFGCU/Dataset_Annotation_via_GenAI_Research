Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The user quotes Ernest Hemingway saying that there's no friend as loyal as a book. That sounds really positive and appreciative. They're talking about celebrating books and developing a positive vision for life. The hashtags are all about promoting reading, which is uplifting.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Since the tweet is expressing appreciation and positivity towards books, it's likely conveying joy or maybe even inspiration. There's no negative language here; everything seems cheerful and encouraging.

I think "joy" fits best because they're celebrating something they love—books—and sharing a positive message about their impact on life. No other emotion like anger or sadness is present. So the primary emotion is joy.
