Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let me read it again: "Hello all Thanks for following us Means a lot to USER channel Please do subscribe to our YouTube channel football united tv :) Many thanks #football #championsleague #fifa #premierleague #laliga #soccer". 

The user is thanking their followers and asking them to subscribe to their YouTube channel. They also included some positive emojis, like the smiley face. The hashtags are related to football leagues, which seems neutral but part of their content.

I'm thinking about the emotions listed: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet is expressing gratitude and a request in a friendly manner. The smiley emoji suggests happiness or friendliness. There's no indication of any negative emotion like anger or disgust. They're excited about their channel growth, which leans towards joy.

So the primary emotion here is joy because they're sharing positive feelings and enthusiasm about their work.
