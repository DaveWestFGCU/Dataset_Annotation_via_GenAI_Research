Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The user is sharing a happy message and suggesting some books for IT professionals. They're using positive language like "Happy" and emojis which indicate joy. There's no negative or neutral tone here; it's all about celebrating reading and promoting professional development. So, the emotion conveyed is definitely joy.
