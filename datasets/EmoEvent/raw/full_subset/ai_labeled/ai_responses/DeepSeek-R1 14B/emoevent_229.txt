Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral Fire. The user is talking about Democrats criticizing POTUS for suggesting to fight the fire with water and expressing surprise that they're not blaming him for the fire itself.

First, let's break down the content. The tweet mentions the Notre-Dame Cathedral Fire, which was a significant event. The author is pointing out that Democrats are running out of criticism points and now are targeting POTUS for his suggestion to use water on the fire. They find this surprising because they expected more direct blame.

The key emotion here seems to be surprise. The author is surprised by the Democrats' reaction, which is unexpected or unusual. They didn't anticipate that the criticism would take this particular form, hence the element of surprise in their statement.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: surprise includes secondary emotions like distraction or amazement. In this case, the author's reaction to the Democrats' behavior fits into that category because it's an unexpected twist in how they're handling the situation.

I don't think it's anger because there's no direct expression of rage or annoyance towards the Democrats; instead, it's more about being surprised by their actions. Disgust doesn't fit either because the tweet isn't expressing dislike but rather astonishment at the approach taken.

So, considering all this, the emotion here is surprise.
