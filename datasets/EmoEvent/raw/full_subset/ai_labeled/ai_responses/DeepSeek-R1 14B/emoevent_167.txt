Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is talking about billionaires donating money to fix a church while they could donate to more important things. Hmm, that sounds like the author is upset or annoyed because they think the priorities are misplaced. So, maybe it's anger? Yeah, I think that's right.
