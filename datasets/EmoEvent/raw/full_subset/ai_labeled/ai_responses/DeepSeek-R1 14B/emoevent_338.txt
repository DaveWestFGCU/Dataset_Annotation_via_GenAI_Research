Okay, let's try to figure out the emotion in this tweet. The tweet is from "Game of Thrones," which I know is a popular TV series. The content of the tweet is: “Uh, Miss Stark.... I don’t feel so good....” with some hashtags like #AryaStark and #GameofThrones.

First, looking at the text itself, it's a quote from the show where someone is addressing Arya Stark and saying they don't feel well. The tone here seems a bit uncertain or hesitant because of the "Uh" at the beginning. It doesn't express any strong emotion like anger or joy; instead, it's more of a statement about feeling unwell.

The hashtags used are #AryaStark and #GameofThrones, which are related to the show but don't add much emotional context on their own. The link provided might be a video or image, but without seeing it, I can't tell if it adds any emotion.

Considering the mapping guidelines, secondary emotions like pensiveness or grief fall under sadness. The tweet doesn't express strong positive or negative feelings but seems more neutral or reflective. However, since neutrality isn't an option, I have to choose the closest emotion from the list.

The hesitation and the statement about not feeling good might indicate some level of concern or worry, which could be linked to fear or anxiety. Alternatively, it's possible that the speaker is just making a factual statement without any strong emotion, but since I need to pick one, I'll go with the closest fit.

I think the primary emotion here is sadness because the person is expressing discomfort or illness, which can evoke feelings of concern or sorrow.
