Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The tweet says: "#WorldBookDay Who is absolute divine? What is her name? How is her devotion All the information will be known. Human life will be successful." 

Hmm, let's break it down. First, the mention of World Book Day is positive because it's a celebration of reading and books. But then the tweet starts asking questions about "Who is absolute divine?" and "What is her name?" It seems like they're talking about someone important or maybe a religious figure? The use of words like "divine" suggests something spiritual.

The next part says, "All the information will be known." That sounds hopeful, like things are going to become clear. Then it ends with "Human life will be successful," which is definitely positive and hopeful. 

So putting it all together, the tweet seems to express hope or optimism about revealing important information that will lead to success in human life. There's no negative language here; everything points towards positivity and looking forward to good outcomes.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The primary emotion here is joy because it's expressing hope and positive expectations for the future.
