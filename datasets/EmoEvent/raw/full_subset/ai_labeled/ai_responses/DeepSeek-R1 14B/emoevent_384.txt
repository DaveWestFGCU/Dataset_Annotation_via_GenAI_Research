Record: "USER USER USER "..that’s what USER wants.". Good to see you've given up the pretence that this is about the #Venezuelan people.  Now about the make up of those pro opposition demonstrators, maybe not so representative of #Venezuela... https://t.co/EPxRboaHno"

Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion behind it. The user is responding to someone else who said, "that’s what USER wants." Then they say, "Good to see you've given up the pretence that this is about the #Venezuelan people." This part seems critical, pointing out that the other person has stopped pretending and is now revealing their true intentions. 

Next, the user questions whether the pro-opposition demonstrators are representative of all Venezuelans. They include a link, probably to some evidence or another viewpoint. The tone here feels sarcastic and dismissive. Words like "pretence" suggest mockery, implying that the other side isn't genuine in their claims about representing Venezuelans.

Looking at the context of Venezuela's political crisis, there's a lot of tension between supporters of Maduro and Guaido. This tweet seems to be part of that debate, taking a stance against the opposition's representation. The user is likely frustrated or annoyed with how the situation is being portrayed, hence the sarcastic tone.

Considering the emotion mapping guidelines, sarcasm and mockery often fall under secondary emotions like annoyance or irritation, which are classified as anger. There's no clear sign of fear, joy, sadness, disgust (like loathing), or surprise here. The focus is more on calling out the other side's insincerity, which leans towards anger.
