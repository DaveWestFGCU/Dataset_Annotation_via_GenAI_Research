Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet starts with a bunch of trophies and mentions Leo Messi claiming his 10th LaLiga title. Barcelona defeated Levante 1-0, and Messi scored the decisive goal in the second half. The hashtags include #Messi, #LaLiga, and others related to football.

Hmm, so this is about Messi winning another title. That sounds like a positive achievement. The use of trophies and emojis suggests celebration or pride. Messi's success would likely make fans happy. There's no negative language here; it's all about the victory and his contribution.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Since it's about winning and celebrating, joy seems to fit best. The tweet doesn't express any other emotions like fear or surprise; it's purely about a successful outcome.
