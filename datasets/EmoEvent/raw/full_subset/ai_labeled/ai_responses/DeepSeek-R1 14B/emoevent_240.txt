Record: "USER Honestly dude you aren't the worst man out there. Weirdly enough there are real life villains and you aren't one of them. Never though I'd say this but thank you for trying more than most for #Venezuela."

Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. The user is addressing someone they're calling "dude" and says he isn't the worst man out there. They mention that there are real villains but imply that this person isn't one of them. Then they say they never thought they'd say it, but thank the person for trying more than most.

Hmm, so the user is expressing gratitude towards someone who's making an effort in a tough situation. The tone seems positive and appreciative. They're acknowledging that despite the chaos, this person is putting in an effort, which is commendable. Words like "thank you" and "trying more than most" indicate appreciation and positivity.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet doesn't show any negative emotions; instead, it's uplifting. So, the closest emotion would be joy because they're expressing gratitude and positive feelings towards someone in a difficult situation.
