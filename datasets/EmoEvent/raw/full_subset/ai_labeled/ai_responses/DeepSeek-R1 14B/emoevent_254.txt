Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says, "Happy #WorldBookDay everyone! What are you reading to celebrate? https://t.co/gRYH3TqzFj". 

First, the word "Happy" stands out. That's a strong indicator of joy. The author is celebrating World Book Day and seems excited about it. They're asking others what they're reading, which shows enthusiasm.

Looking at the context provided, World Book Day is an event promoted by UNESCO to encourage reading. So the tweet is likely part of that celebration. The use of "Happy" and the exclamation mark both contribute to a positive tone.

I should consider if there's any other emotion here. There's no sign of anger, disgust, fear, or surprise. It's all about celebrating books and reading, which aligns with joy. 

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion is definitely joy.
