Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let's break it down.

The tweet says: "Another beautiful Sunday evening to kick fascism buttsðŸ’œ ...#SpainElection #votadhermanas  #EleccionesGenerales28A #28AÂ  #FelizDomingo"

First, I notice the use of "beautiful" which is a positive word. The author is talking about a Sunday evening in a positive light. They also mention "kick fascism butts," which seems like they're taking action against something negativeâ€”fascism. But the way it's phrased with "butts" and the emoji might be playful or sarcastic, not necessarily angry.

The emojis used are a purple heart ðŸ’œ, which often symbolizes love, solidarity, or support. The hashtags include election-related ones like #SpainElection and #EleccionesGenerales28A, as well as #FelizDomingo, which means "Happy Sunday" in Spanish. These suggest the author is involved in or supportive of the election process.

Putting it together, the tweet seems to express a sense of positivity and engagement. The mention of kicking fascism butts could be more about taking action against something negative they care about, but the overall tone doesn't seem angry or fearful. Instead, it feels like the author is motivated and happy about participating in the election.

So considering the guidelines, joy would fit here because the tweet conveys a positive emotion, possibly excitement or satisfaction related to their political involvement.
