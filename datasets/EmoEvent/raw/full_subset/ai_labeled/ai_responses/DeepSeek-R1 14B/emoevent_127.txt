Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The user is promoting a book and encouraging others to read it. They're using positive emojis like a heart and winks, which suggests they're happy or excited. There's no negative language here; everything seems upbeat and enthusiastic. So, the emotion conveyed is joy.
