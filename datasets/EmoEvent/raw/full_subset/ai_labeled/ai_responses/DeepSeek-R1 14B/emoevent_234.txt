Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says, "Theon. You are a good man. Thank you." and includes a hashtag for Game of Thrones.

First, let me break down what's being expressed here. The user is addressing Theon, calling him a good man and thanking him. That sounds positive. The words "good" and "thank you" usually indicate gratitude or appreciation. 

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to pick one that best fits. Gratitude is a form of joy because it's a positive feeling. There's no indication of any negative emotions hereâ€”no anger, disgust, fear, or sadness. Surprise would be if something unexpected happened, but this seems more about appreciation.

So the emotion conveyed is joy because the user is expressing thanks and praise.
