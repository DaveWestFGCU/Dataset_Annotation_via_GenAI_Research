Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. The user wrote, "Thanks for the update. Praying for the ppl of #Venezuela tonight." 

First, let me break down the components. The user is thanking someone for an update, which shows appreciation. Then they mention praying for the people of Venezuela. Prayer often indicates concern or empathy towards others' situations.

Looking at the context provided, there's a crisis regarding who is the legitimate president between Maduro and Guaido. This situation is tense and has caused a lot of division both within Venezuela and internationally. So, when someone prays for the people involved in such a conflict, it likely stems from a sense of worry or concern about their well-being.

Now, mapping this to the given emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The user isn't expressing any positive emotions like joy; instead, they're showing care and empathy. However, I need to see if this falls under one of the secondary emotions listed in the guidelines.

The tweet doesn't express a direct negative emotion but rather a supportive one. But according to the instructions, neutrality isn't an option, so I have to choose from the given labels. The closest would be sadness because praying often relates to feeling sorry for others' situations or hoping for positive outcomes amidst hardship. Alternatively, fear could be considered if there's anxiety about the crisis, but the tweet doesn't explicitly mention fear.

Wait, maybe it's more about empathy and concern rather than a direct emotion like sadness. But since I have to choose from the given options, and considering that praying can indicate a sense of sorrow or condolence for those affected, I think sadness is the most appropriate label here.
