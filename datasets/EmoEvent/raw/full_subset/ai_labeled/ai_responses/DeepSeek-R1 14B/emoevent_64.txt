Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says, "Happy #WorldBookDay Inspired from: Alireza Darvish Works https://t.co/0qDKkEh2YV". 

First, the word "Happy" stands out. That's a strong indicator of joy. The user is expressing happiness on World Book Day, which makes sense because it's a day celebrating books and reading. They're probably excited or pleased about this occasion.

Looking at the context provided, World Book Day is meant to promote reading and literature, so the tweet seems positive. The mention of being inspired by Alireza Darvish's works adds to that positive vibe, showing appreciation or enthusiasm towards his work.

I don't see any negative words or sentiments here. There's no indication of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise. It's all about celebrating books and happiness. So the emotion conveyed is definitely joy.
