Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says, "Great episode of #GameofThrones last night, but honestly, #BattleoftheBastards > #BattleofWinterfell IMO." 

First, let's break down what the user is expressing here. They start by saying it was a "great episode," which immediately makes me think they're happy or satisfied with the show. That's a positive emotion, probably joy.

But then there's a转折点 (a turning point) in their statement: "but honestly." This indicates that while they liked the episode, they have a specific preference. They compare two battles: #BattleoftheBastards and #BattleofWinterfell, stating that the former is better than the latter in their opinion.

So, the user isn't just expressing general happiness; they're also sharing their personal opinion about which battle was more impressive or memorable. This shows a strong preference or maybe even excitement about one part of the show over another.

I don't detect any negative emotions here like anger or sadness. They're not complaining or expressing disappointment with the latest episode, but rather highlighting a favorite scene from earlier. Their use of "honestly" adds emphasis to their opinion, which might indicate they feel strongly about it, but that doesn't necessarily translate to surprise or fear.

The mention of specific episodes and battles suggests engagement with the show, which aligns with joy because they're expressing enthusiasm and satisfaction about something they enjoy.

So putting it all together, the primary emotion here is joy. They're happy about watching a great episode and are excitedly sharing their favorite parts.
