Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a tweet and wants me to classify the primary emotion conveyed using one of six labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully: "Anyone noticed the faceless man or I'm wrong !! #GameOfThrones". The user is asking if others have noticed something specific in Game of Thronesâ€”specifically mentioning the "faceless man." They're using an exclamation mark and a hashtag, which might indicate excitement or urgency.

The context given mentions that Game of Thrones was a popular series with its last season premiering in April 2019. The tweet seems to be about a particular element from the show, possibly related to a spoiler or a theory.

Now, analyzing the emotion: The use of "!!" suggests emphasis and excitement. They're eager to know others' thoughts on this point. This could indicate curiosity or enthusiasm rather than negative emotions like anger or sadness.

Looking at the mapping guidelines, surprise is associated with distraction or amazement. While the tweet isn't explicitly expressing shock, the excitement and eagerness might lean towards surprise because they're highlighting something unexpected or intriguing about the show.

I should also consider if there's any indication of other emotions. There's no clear sign of anger (annoyance), disgust (dislike), fear (apprehension), joy (serenity), or sadness (pensiveness). The primary emotion here seems to be excitement, which falls under surprise in the given categories.

Therefore, the appropriate label for this tweet is surprise.
