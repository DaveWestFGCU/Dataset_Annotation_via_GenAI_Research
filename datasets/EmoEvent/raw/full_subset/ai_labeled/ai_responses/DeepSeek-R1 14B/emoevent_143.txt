Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet says: "I’m so inspired by this young girl and at the same time so ashamed/sad of the corruption in politics today that it takes a 13 year old to actually listen and stop with the BS #GretaThunberg #inspiring #womenleaders #ClimateActionNow #ClimateStrike #auspol2019 #VoteGreen2019 https://t.co/Rkl5Yd18Q8"

Alright, breaking it down. The author starts by expressing inspiration from a young girl, which is positive. But then they switch to feeling ashamed and sad about political corruption. So the main emotions here are inspiration (which is joy) and shame/sadness.

But according to the guidelines, I need to pick one primary emotion. The tweet mentions being "ashamed/sad" more explicitly than just inspired. Also, the context is about climate strikes led by Greta Thunberg, which often brings up frustration with political inaction, leading to sadness or disappointment.

So between joy and sadness, the stronger emotion seems to be sadness because of the explicit mention of feeling ashamed and sad. The inspiration part is more of a positive note but the negative emotions are more prominent here.
