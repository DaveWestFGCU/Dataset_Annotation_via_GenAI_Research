Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. Let me read it again: "What you feed your mind determines what you prioritize & ultimately the kind of choices you make. The more you know the better the choices you will make." It's from a user who is a chairperson, and they're using the #WorldBookDay hashtag.

Hmm, this tweet seems to be motivational. They're talking about feeding your mind and how knowledge leads to better decisions. There's no explicit emotion words like happy or sad. But I need to classify it into one of the given emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

Looking at the guidelines, if the emotion is secondary but similar to serenity or ecstasy, it's joy. The tweet feels positive and encouraging, which might relate to joy. It's not expressing any negative feelings like anger or sadness. So I think the primary emotion here is joy because they're promoting knowledge in a uplifting way.
