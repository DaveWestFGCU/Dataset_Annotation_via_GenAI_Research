Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says, "I LOVE BOOKS!!!!!!!! #WorldBookDay #Reading Currently reading a good book, oh yeah." 

First, let's break down the words and the overall tone. The user is using all caps for "LOVE" which usually indicates strong positive feelings. They also added multiple exclamation marks, which emphasizes their excitement. Words like "love" and "good" are clearly positive.

The hashtags used are #WorldBookDay and #Reading, both related to books and reading, which supports the idea that they're expressing a love for books. The phrase "Currently reading a good book" further reinforces this by showing active engagement and satisfaction with their current read.

Looking at the mapping guidelines, joy is associated with emotions like serenity or ecstasy. While the tweet isn't serene, it's definitely expressing a strong positive emotion about reading. There's no indication of any negative feelings or secondary emotions like anger or surprise. The user seems genuinely happy and enthusiastic about books.

So, considering all these points, the primary emotion here is joy.
