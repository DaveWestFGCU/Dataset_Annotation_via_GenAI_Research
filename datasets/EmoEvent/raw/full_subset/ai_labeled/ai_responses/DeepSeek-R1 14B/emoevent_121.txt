Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The tweet says, "Wow! And they don't even have to sell coffee, cards, or socks. Buy a book today -- and read it! #WorldBookDay https://t.co/qBpv52AlRW". 

First, I notice the word "Wow!" which immediately makes me think of surprise or excitement. The author is expressing enthusiasm about buying and reading books without the usual trappings of selling other items like coffee or cards. They're highlighting the simplicity and directness of promoting books on World Book Day.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to pick one that best fits. The use of "Wow!" suggests a positive reaction, but it's more about being impressed rather than happiness or excitement. However, sometimes "wow" can also indicate surprise because something unexpected is happening.

Wait, the guidelines say if it's similar to distraction or amazement, classify as surprise. So in this case, the author seems surprised and happy about the focus on books without other products. But since "Wow!" is a strong positive reaction, maybe it's more about joy? Or perhaps it's a mix of both.

But according to the mapping guidelines, if it's similar to distraction or amazement, it's surprise. So I think "surprise" might be the right label here because the author is expressing that they didn't expect this approach and are finding it impressive.
