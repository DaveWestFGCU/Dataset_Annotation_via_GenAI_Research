Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The user is talking about Venezuela's political crisis and mentions that they aren't advocating for killing or assassination but still wants Maduro removed from power. 

First, looking at the content, the user expresses a strong desire for change. They're frustrated with the current situation and feel that drastic measures might be necessary, even though they don't support violence. This frustration could stem from various reasons like the political instability, economic issues, or human rights concerns in Venezuela.

The emotion here isn't just mild dissatisfaction; it's more intense. The user is advocating for the removal of a leader, which suggests a deeper issue with the current state of affairs. They might be feeling anger because they see Maduro as a problem that needs to be addressed, even if through non-violent means.

I should consider other emotions too. Is there any sign of disgust? Maybe towards Maduro's policies or actions, but the primary emotion seems more about frustration and desire for change. Fear could be involved if they're worried about the future, but the main sentiment appears to be a call to action against the current leader.

Joy isn't present here; it's more about negative feelings. Sadness might come into play with the country's situation, but again, the primary emotion is frustration and anger towards Maduro's continued leadership.

So, putting it all together, the user's main emotion is likely anger because they're advocating for the removal of a leader they see as problematic, expressing strong opposition.
