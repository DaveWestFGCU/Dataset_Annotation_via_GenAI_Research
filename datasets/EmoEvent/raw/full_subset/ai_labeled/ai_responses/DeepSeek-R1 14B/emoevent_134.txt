Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is talking about their team restoring a historic building into new retail space while preserving details and history. They're sharing a link with hashtags related to conservation and restoration.

First, let's break down the content. The tweet mentions "sensitively restored," which suggests care and attention to detail. Words like "preserving the detail, character & history" indicate respect for the building's heritage. The use of positive terms like "create new retail space" might imply excitement or satisfaction with the outcome.

Looking at the hashtags: #conservation, #restoration, #StokeOnTrent, #SenseofUnity, and #NotreDameCathedralFire. These are all related to preservation efforts and community unity, which are positive themes.

The context given is about a fire that destroyed part of Notre Dame, but the tweet isn't reacting directly to the fire. Instead, it's showcasing their work post-disaster. The tone seems proud and positive about their achievements in restoration.

Considering the emotion mapping guidelines: If the emotion is similar to serenity or ecstasy, classify as joy. Here, the author seems happy and satisfied with their accomplishment, which aligns with joy.
