Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The user wrote, "Happy #WorldBookDay. I have no literary criteria. I just like good stories." Let me break this down.

First, the tweet starts with "Happy," which immediately suggests a positive feeling. That's a strong indicator of joy or maybe surprise, but more likely joy since it's an expression of happiness.

Next, they mention having no literary criteria and that they just like good stories. This comes off as genuine and enthusiastic about reading, which again points towards a positive emotion. There's no negative language here; instead, it's all about enjoyment and appreciation for storytelling.

Looking at the context provided, World Book Day is meant to promote reading and books, so the tweet aligns with that theme positively. The use of "Happy" reinforces the celebratory tone.

Considering the mapping guidelines: joy includes emotions like serenity or ecstasy. While this isn't overly ecstatic, the enthusiasm about enjoying stories fits within a joyful context. There's no sign of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise here.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion is joy.
