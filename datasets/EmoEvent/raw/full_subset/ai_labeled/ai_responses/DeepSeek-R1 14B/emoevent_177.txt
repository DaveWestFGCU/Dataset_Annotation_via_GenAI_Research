Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is talking about how sad the fire was but then points out that millionaires donated over a billion euros to rebuild it instead of helping with a humanitarian crisis. They end with a shrug emoji and some hashtags.

First, let's break down the content. The tweet starts by acknowledging the sadness of the event, which might suggest sadness as an emotion. But then the tone shifts to questioning why so much money went into reconstruction rather than aiding those in need. This part seems more critical or disappointed.

The shrug emoji adds a layer of sarcasm or disbelief. It's like they're not just sad but also frustrated or annoyed that resources are being allocated this way. So, while there's an initial sadness about the fire, the overall sentiment seems to be more about frustration with the priorities of the donors.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: if it's similar to annoyance or rage, it's anger. The frustration expressed here fits under anger because they're upset about the situation and perhaps feel that the money could have been better used elsewhere.

I don't think it's disgust because it's not about disliking something directly but more about being annoyed at the actions of others. Fear isn't present, nor is joy or surprise. Sadness is part of it, but the primary emotion seems to be the frustration and anger towards the situation.
