Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. Let me read it carefully.

The user is talking about monitoring lies from the USA in Venezuela closely. They mention that the US didn't stand with the people and their freedom, and they emphasize "NEVER did" regarding Venezuela and Golan Heights. The hashtags include #USA, #IsraeliCrimes, #Myanmar, and others related to force, racism, and hate.

The tone here seems strong and critical towards the USA's actions. Words like "lies," "force," "racismo," and "hate" indicate frustration or anger. The user is expressing dissatisfaction and perhaps a sense of betrayal that the US didn't support freedom as expected.

Looking at the mapping guidelines, if it's similar to annoyance or rage, it's classified as anger. This tweet definitely has elements of both frustration and strong disapproval, which aligns with anger rather than other emotions like fear or sadness.
