Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet is about an interview with Sir David King, who's a former government chief science advisor, talking about climate change policy and some hashtags related to Greta Thunberg and extinction rebellion.

First, let me break down the content. The user is sharing a link to an interview they found great. They're using positive language like "Great" which immediately suggests a positive emotion. The mention of Sir David King adds credibility, implying that the user respects his expertise on climate change. The hashtags #extinctionrebellion and #GretaThunberg are both associated with movements focused on environmental activism, which is likely something the user supports.

The overall tone seems approving and supportive. They're sharing this interview, probably because they agree with the message or find it inspiring. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or disgust. Instead, it feels more like excitement or satisfaction in finding such a resource.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: joy is associated with serenity or ecstasy, but also includes positive feelings and approval. Since the tweet expresses approval and shares something they find valuable, it fits under joy.
