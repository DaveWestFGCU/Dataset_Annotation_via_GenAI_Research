Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user wrote, "I was surprised it took almost 24 hours for some anti-Islamic news to show up on my feed regarding #NotreDameCathedralFire." 

First, let's break down the content. They're talking about their surprise that it took so long for certain types of news (anti-Islamic) to appear after the fire. The key word here is "surprised," which directly points towards the emotion of surprise.

Looking at the mapping guidelines, surprise is one of the primary emotions we need to classify. Secondary emotions under surprise include distraction or amazement, but in this case, the tweet explicitly mentions being surprised, so it fits perfectly into the surprise category.

I don't see any other emotions like anger or fear here; the focus is on the unexpected delay of specific news coverage. So, the emotion conveyed is definitely surprise.
