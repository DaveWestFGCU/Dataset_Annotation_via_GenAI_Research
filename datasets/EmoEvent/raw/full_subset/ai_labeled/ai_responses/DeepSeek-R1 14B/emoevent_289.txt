Okay, I need to determine the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about World Book Day. The user is talking about books as friends and companions, which sounds positive. They also mention getting lost in the world of books and wish others happy reading. These expressions are filled with enthusiasm and happiness. So, the emotion here is joy.
