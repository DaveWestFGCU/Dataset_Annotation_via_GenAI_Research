Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user mentions that people discussing the possibility of radical Islam being responsible were cut off by Neil Cavuto and Shepard Smith. Hmm, the tweet seems to be pointing out a situation where certain opinions were silenced.

I should consider what emotions are associated with such a scenario. If someone's viewpoint is being shut down, especially on an important issue like a terrorist attack, they might feel frustrated or annoyed. Frustration can often fall under anger because it's a form of irritation or displeasure at being obstructed.

Looking at the mapping guidelines: if the emotion is similar to annoyance or rage, it's classified as anger. In this case, the user seems upset that these individuals were silenced, which likely stems from frustration or anger towards the media figures for cutting off the discussion.

I don't think it's disgust because there's no clear indication of dislike towards a person or object; rather, it's about the silencing. Fear isn't applicable here either since there's no threat mentioned. Joy and surprise are out of the question as well. Sadness might be if someone was mourning the loss, but this tweet is more about the suppression of discussion.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion seems to be anger due to frustration at being cut off.
