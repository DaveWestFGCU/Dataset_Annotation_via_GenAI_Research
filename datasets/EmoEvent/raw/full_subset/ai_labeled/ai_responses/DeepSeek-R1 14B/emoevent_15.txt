Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user wrote: "#NotreDameCathedralFire the people that are saying that Notre Dame is “just a building”, are heartless. i pray you realize the bigger picture here."

First, let's break down the content. The tweet is addressing people who dismiss the cathedral as just a building. The author calls them "heartless," which suggests they're upset or disappointed with such attitudes. Then, they mention praying that these people realize the bigger picture, indicating concern or hope for their understanding.

The emotion here seems to be sadness because the author is expressing disappointment and concern about others' lack of empathy. They're not angry in a rageful way but rather feeling down about the situation. There's also an element of wanting others to see the significance, which adds to the sad tone.
