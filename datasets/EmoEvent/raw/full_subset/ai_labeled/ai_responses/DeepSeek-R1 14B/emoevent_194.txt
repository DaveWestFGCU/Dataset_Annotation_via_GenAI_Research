Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Venezuela's crisis. The user wrote, "Feeding the military industrial complex and feeding war is not the answer for #Venezuela. Attention needs to be paid to Saudi Arabia and their terrorism around the globe." 

First, let me break down the content. They're talking about the military-industrial complex and how it leads to more war, which they don't think is the solution for Venezuela. Then they shift focus to Saudi Arabia's role in global terrorism.

The tone here seems critical and concerned. The user is pointing out issues with both Venezuela's situation and broader international policies. They're expressing disapproval of certain actions and their consequences. 

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines, I need to see which primary emotion fits best. Anger is about annoyance or rage; disgust is for things like dislike or loathing. Here, the user isn't just angry but seems more disgusted by the actions they're criticizing.

They express a strong disapproval of feeding war and terrorism, which aligns with feelings of disgust rather than anger. There's no indication of fear, joy, sadness, or surprise in this tweet. The focus is on condemning these practices, which points towards disgust.
