Record: "USER USER #NotreDameCathedralFire. Yes this fire is tragic, but when you see how the wealthy and mega rich have rallied to the cause compared to how they rallied around #GrenfellTower tragedy, where many people died. It just makes me question priorities."

Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is talking about the tragedy of the fire but then compares it to the response after Grenfell Tower, pointing out that the wealthy are more supportive for Notre Dame. They end by saying it makes them question priorities.

Hmm, so the main emotions here seem to be sadness because they're talking about a tragic event and people dying. But there's also some frustration or disappointment in how resources are allocated differently based on the situation. However, according to the guidelines, if the emotion is similar to pensiveness or grief, it should be classified as sadness. The frustration might lean towards anger, but the primary focus seems to be on the tragedy and questioning priorities, which I think relates more to sadness.
