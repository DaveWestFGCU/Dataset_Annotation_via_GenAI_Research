Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user wrote, "Tossed but not sunk...I like that💗💪🏻 We can all rebuild, no matter how tossed or how much the tearing down hurt or cost us. Strong buttresses can withstand a lot..." 

First, I notice the use of words like "tossed" and "not sunk," which suggests resilience. The emojis used are a heart and a muscle flex, indicating positivity and strength. They mention rebuilding despite the pain and costs, which shows determination. Phrases like "strong buttresses" metaphorically refer to overcoming challenges.

The overall tone seems hopeful and encouraging. The author is focusing on moving forward and not letting the setback defeat them. There's an emphasis on resilience and strength, which are positive emotions. They're not expressing any negative feelings but rather uplifting messages.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. This tweet doesn't show any of the first three; it's more about overcoming adversity. The feeling here is definitely positive, so joy or maybe even surprise could be considered. However, since they're talking about rebuilding and strength, it's more aligned with joy because it's about finding positivity in a tough situation.

I don't think it's surprise because there's no element of unexpectedness; instead, it's about determination. So the primary emotion is joy.
