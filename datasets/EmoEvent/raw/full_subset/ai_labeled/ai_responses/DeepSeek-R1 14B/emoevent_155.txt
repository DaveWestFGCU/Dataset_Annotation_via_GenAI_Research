Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The user is talking about Leo Messi and uses words like "rise," "applaud," "adore." These all sound positive. They also mention Messi as the "one true 🐐✌️" which I think refers to him being the greatest, maybe using a goat emoji (🐐) as a symbol for G.O.A.T., Greatest Of All Time. The hashtags include #leomessi, #BarcelonaLiverpool, and others related to football clubs and competitions like the Champions League.

The overall tone seems very admiring and celebratory. They're praising Messi and showing support for Barcelona. There's no negative language or any signs of distress. So, considering the guidelines, if it's a secondary emotion similar to serenity or ecstasy, that would be joy. The user is expressing admiration and excitement, which fits under joy.
