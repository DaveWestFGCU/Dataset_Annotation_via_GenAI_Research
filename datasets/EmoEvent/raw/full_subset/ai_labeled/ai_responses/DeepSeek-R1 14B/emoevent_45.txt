Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Venezuela's situation. The user mentioned a crisis regarding who is the legitimate president since January 2019, with support divided between Maduro and Guaido.

Looking at the tweet itself: "This #Venezuela coup is disappointingly non-violent. I've seen more people get crushed in the Central line stairways at Bond Street station." 

First, the hashtag suggests it's about Venezuela, likely referring to the political turmoil there. The user says the coup is "disappointingly non-violent," which implies they were expecting something more dramatic or violent but found it underwhelming.

The second part of the tweet compares this situation to a personal experience where people were crushed on the stairs at Bond Street station. This comparison seems to highlight a lack of excitement or action in the Venezuelan context, perhaps indicating that real-life situations can be more intense than political events.

So, the emotion here is disappointment because the user expected something more exciting or violent but found it lacking. Disappointment falls under the disgust category as per the guidelines since it's a secondary emotion related to dislike or disinterest.
