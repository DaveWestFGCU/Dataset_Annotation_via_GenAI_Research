Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says, "That's why Messi is the best player in the world #ChampionsLeague." Let me break it down.

First, the context mentions that the UEFA Champions League is a prestigious football competition where top European clubs compete. So, the hashtag here relates to that competition.

The tweet is expressing a view about Messi being the best player. The phrase "That's why" suggests that the speaker is explaining or highlighting a reason for their opinion. The use of "best player in the world" indicates admiration and praise.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: joy includes emotions like serenity or ecstasy, which are positive feelings. Since the tweet is expressing pride and happiness about Messi's skill, it aligns with joy.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise here. It's a straightforward compliment, so the emotion is likely joy.
