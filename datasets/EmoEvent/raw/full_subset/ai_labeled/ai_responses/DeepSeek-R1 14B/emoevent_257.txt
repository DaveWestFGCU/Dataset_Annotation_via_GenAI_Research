Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. Let's break it down.

The tweet says, "I am an absolute mess. That was the most amazing thing I have ever watched in my entire life #gameofthrones." 

First, the user refers to themselves as being an "absolute mess," which might indicate they're feeling overwhelmed or emotional. Then they describe the show as "the most amazing thing" they've ever watched. The word "amazing" is a strong positive adjective, suggesting joy or excitement.

Looking at the context, Game of Thrones is known for its intense and emotionally charged storylines, so it's common for fans to have strong reactions. The use of hashtags like #gameofthrones also indicates engagement with the series.

The emotion here seems to be one of awe and delight. "Amazing" directly relates to joy or ecstasy, which falls under the joy category according to the guidelines. There's no indication of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise in the tweet. The focus is purely on positive feelings about the show.

So, considering all this, the primary emotion is joy.
