Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says: "Struggling #Madrid held to goalless draw by Getafe - Gulf Times #GetafeCF ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ #LaLiga". 

First, let's break down the content. Madrid is struggling and they ended up in a goalless draw against Getafe. A goalless draw usually means neither team scored, so it's a bit of a stalemate. The word "struggling" suggests that Madrid isn't performing well, which might make their fans feel something.

Now, thinking about the emotions: If I were a fan of Madrid, seeing them struggle and not win would probably make me feel disappointed or maybe even sad. They didn't get the result they wanted, so there's an element of not achieving something desired. 

Looking at the mapping guidelines, sadness is associated with pensiveness or grief. In this context, the fans might be feeling down because their team didn't win, which aligns with sadness rather than other emotions like anger or surprise.

I don't think it's fear because there's no indication of any impending danger or threat. It's not disgust either; it's more about the outcome of the game being disappointing. Joy is out of the question since they didn't win. Surprise would be if something unexpected happened, but a draw after struggling isn't that surprising.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion here seems to be sadness because of the disappointment from not winning despite their struggle.
