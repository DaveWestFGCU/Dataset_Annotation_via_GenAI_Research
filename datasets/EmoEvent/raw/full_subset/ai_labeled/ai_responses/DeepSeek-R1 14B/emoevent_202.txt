Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet is: "Important message from New Brunswick Student #Fridaysforfuture rep. #ClimateStrike #cdnpoli #GretaThunberg #FridayForFuture https://t.co/nGgxD8hpwL". 

First, let me break down what's happening here. It mentions Greta Thunberg and the movement "Fridays for Future," which I know is about climate strikes. The user is sharing an important message from a student representative in New Brunswick. They're using several hashtags related to climate issues and Greta.

Now, thinking about emotions: Is there any indication of strong feelings like anger or joy? The tweet seems more informational than emotional. It's announcing a message but doesn't express personal feelings. There are no words that show happiness, sadness, fear, etc. It's just stating facts with hashtags.

But wait, the guidelines say if there's no expressed emotion, I still have to choose one of the six labels. So even though it's neutral in tone, I can't leave it at that. I need to pick the closest emotion from the list.

Looking at the context, Fridays for Future is a movement about climate change, which is a serious issue. People involved might feel concerned or anxious, but the tweet itself doesn't express those feelings. It's more of an announcement or sharing information.

So considering all this, I think the primary emotion here isn't explicitly stated. But since it's related to a cause that people care about, maybe there's an underlying emotion. However, without explicit words showing emotion, it's tricky. The closest might be sadness because climate issues can evoke concern or sorrow, but again, the tweet doesn't directly express that.

Alternatively, maybe surprise? Because it's sharing news, but I don't think so. Or perhaps fear if it's about a serious issue, but again, no explicit emotion words.

Wait, the guidelines say to choose one of anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Since there's no expressed emotion, I have to pick based on context. The movement is about climate change, which often evokes concern or worry, but those aren't in the list. So maybe the closest would be fear because it's a serious issue that people might fear for the future.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, since it's just sharing information without emotion, perhaps sadness as a default? Or maybe surprise if it's unexpected news, but again, no indication of that.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should go with fear because climate change can be a scary topic, even though the tweet itself isn't expressing that emotion.
