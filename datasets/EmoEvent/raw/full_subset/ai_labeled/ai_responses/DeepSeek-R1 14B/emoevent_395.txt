Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says, "I’ve watched episode 3, the battle for winterfell 3 times today!! It is f**king epic!! #GameOfThrones #BattleForWinterfell #GOT". 

First, let's break down the content. The user mentions watching an episode three times in one day and calls it "epic." They also used some strong language with "f**king," which adds emphasis to their excitement.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: anger is for annoyance or rage; disgust for disinterest or dislike; fear for apprehension or anxiety; joy for serenity or ecstasy; sadness for pensiveness or grief; surprise for distraction or amazement.

The tweet expresses high enthusiasm and excitement. The use of "epic" and exclamation marks shows strong positive feelings. Even though they used a swear word, it's more to emphasize their enjoyment rather than expressing anger or disgust. 

So the emotion here is joy because they're clearly thrilled about the episode.
