Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Greta Thunberg and other teens. The tweet is highlighting these individuals as changemakers who are making a global impact. It uses positive hashtags like #activismo, #activism, and mentions their causes. The tone seems appreciative and supportive. There's no negative language or signs of any other emotion besides admiration. So the primary emotion here is joy because it's celebrating their achievements.
