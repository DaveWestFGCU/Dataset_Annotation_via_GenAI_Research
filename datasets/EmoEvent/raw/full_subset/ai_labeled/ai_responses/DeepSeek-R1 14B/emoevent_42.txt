Record: "USER I think I can speak for a very pissed off #Venezuelan Zumba Dancers &amp; their friends. And we have easy access to more guns you can imagine a human being can buy in an urban warfare store. Call us. We will come. Do a #Khashoggi on #maduro in Broad Daylight. #Venezuela"

Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the primary emotion conveyed. The user is talking about Venezuelan Zumba dancers being "pissed off," which immediately makes me think of anger or frustration. They mention having access to guns and suggest taking action against Maduro in broad daylight, referencing Khashoggi, which implies a desire for retribution or violence. The overall tone seems confrontational and filled with rage towards the political situation in Venezuela. So, the emotion here is clearly anger.
