Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says, "You guys are mad because #Venezuela is dumping that Dollar." First, let me break down what's being said here.

The context given is about Venezuela's presidential crisis, which started on January 10th, 2019. It involves who the legitimate president is between Nicolas Maduro and Juan Guaido. So, there's a lot of tension and division in the country and internationally regarding this issue.

Looking at the tweet itself: "You guys are mad because #Venezuela is dumping that Dollar." The word "mad" here seems to be the key indicator. In English, when someone says "you guys are mad," they're often expressing frustration or anger towards others for their actions or opinions. So, in this context, the author is calling out others as being angry or frustrated because Venezuela is getting rid of the dollar.

Now, considering the mapping guidelines: if the emotion is similar to annoyance or rage, it's classified as anger. Here, "mad" directly relates to anger. The tweet isn't expressing any other emotions like fear, joy, disgust, etc., but rather frustration towards others' reactions regarding Venezuela's economic move (dumping the dollar). 

I should also consider if there are any secondary emotions involved. The author is pointing out that others are mad, which implies that the author might be frustrated with those people's reactions. This frustration aligns with anger.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion here is clearly anger because of the use of "mad" and the context of a tense political situation.
