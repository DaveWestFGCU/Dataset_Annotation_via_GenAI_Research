Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The user is talking about their sci-fi book being complete at 93k words and mentions elements like war, aliens, spaceships, difficult sexuality, and climate change. They're pitching it on World Book Day, which is an event promoting reading and publishing.

Looking at the language, they seem excited to share their work. Words like "perfect place" and "complete" show that they've finished something they're proud of. The enthusiasm in mentioning all the elements suggests they're eager to get their book noticed by literary agents and publishers. There's no negative language here; instead, it's more about opportunity and achievement.

Considering the emotion categories: anger is out because there's no frustration. Disgust doesn't fit either since they're not expressing dislike. Fear isn't present as there's no anxiety mentioned. Sadness is also absentâ€”no signs of grief or pensiveness. Surprise might be a stretch unless something unexpected happened, but that's not the case here.

The primary emotion seems to be joy because they're sharing their accomplishment and excitement about their book in a positive light. They're happy to participate in the event and promote their work.
