Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user wrote, "You were a structure unlike any other and the world is poorer for your lose." Hmm, let me break this down.

First, the tweet mentions that Notre Dame was a unique structure and now the world is poorer because of its loss. The word "poorer" suggests something negative, indicating a sense of loss or sadness. They're expressing that losing such an iconic building has made the world worse off, which points towards a feeling of sorrow.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Sadness seems to fit here because they're talking about the loss and the negative impact on the world. There's no indication of anger or frustration; it's more about mourning something lost. Disgust doesn't apply because there's nothing repulsive mentioned. Fear isn't present eitherâ€”no threats or dangers discussed beyond the fire itself, which is already a past event. Joy and surprise are definitely not applicable here since the tone is somber.

So, considering all this, the emotion conveyed is sadness.
