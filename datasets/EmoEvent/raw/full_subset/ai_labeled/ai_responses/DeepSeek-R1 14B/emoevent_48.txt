Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says, "The interesting thing about #GameofThrones #GOTS08E03 is getting to see the night king smiling. EPIC https://t.co/QytU9OU8vt". 

First, let's break down the content. The user is talking about an episode of Game of Thrones, specifically mentioning that it's interesting to see the Night King smiling. They also use the word "EPIC," which usually conveys excitement or enthusiasm.

The emotion mapping guidelines say that if the tweet shows something like serenity or ecstasy, we classify it as joy. The word "EPIC" definitely sounds positive and excited. Also, seeing the Night King smile might be a surprising or thrilling moment for fans, which could contribute to that epic feeling.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise here. It's more about excitement and positivity. So, the emotion should be joy.
