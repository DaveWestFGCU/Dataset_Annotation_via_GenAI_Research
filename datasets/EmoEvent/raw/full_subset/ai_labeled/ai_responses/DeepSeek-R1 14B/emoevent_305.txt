Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says, "Hands down the best bit of tv I’ve ever watched #GameofThrones." 

First, let's break it down. The user is expressing their opinion about Game of Thrones. They're using superlatives like "best bit" and "ever watched," which indicates strong positive feelings. The hashtag also shows they're part of the community or interested in the show.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to pick one that fits best. The tweet is clearly a compliment, so it's not any negative emotion like anger or disgust. It doesn't express fear or sadness either. 

The key here is "Hands down" and "best bit," which are expressions of enthusiasm and satisfaction. That sounds like joy because they're expressing happiness and excitement about the show. There's no element of surprise in the tweet; it's more about praise.

So, considering all that, the emotion should be joy.
