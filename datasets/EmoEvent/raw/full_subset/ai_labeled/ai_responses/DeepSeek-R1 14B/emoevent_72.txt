Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. The user is talking about someone who hacked and refers to Obama as a flunkie. They mention that this person thinks Venezuelans fighting for freedom against an illegitimate socialist dictator is a coup. The user ends with a hand gesture emoji, which I think is expressing frustration or disbelief.

Looking at the mapping guidelines, if it's frustration or disbelief, those fall under secondary emotions similar to annoyance or rage, so that would be anger. Alternatively, the disbelief could also relate to surprise, but since the primary emotion seems more like frustration and maybe a bit of anger towards someone misunderstanding the situation, I think anger is the right classification.
