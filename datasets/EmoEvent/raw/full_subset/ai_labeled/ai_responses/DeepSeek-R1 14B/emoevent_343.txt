Record: "NUSCR sends their thoughts and prayers to the people of #Paris. #NotreDame #NotreDameCathedralFire  Unfortunately, all of our students are home for the Easter Break so we are unable to organise ringing at All Saints' tomorrow."

Okay, I need to determine the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet regarding the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user mentions sending thoughts and prayers, which indicates empathy or concern. They also note that their students can't organize a ringing event because they're on break. This shows understanding but doesn't express strong negative emotions like anger or disgust. The overall tone is somber and supportive, leaning towards sadness rather than other emotions.
