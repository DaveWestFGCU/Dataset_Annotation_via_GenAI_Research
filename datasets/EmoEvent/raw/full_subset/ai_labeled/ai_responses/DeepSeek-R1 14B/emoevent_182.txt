Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says, "98,299 watching this great game at the Nou Camp .... amazing. #BARLIV #ChampionsLeague #BFCvLFC". 

First, let's break down the content. The user is mentioning a large number of people watching a game at the Nou Camp, which is a famous stadium known for FC Barcelona matches. They describe it as "great" and then use the word "amazing." The hashtags are related to football clubs and competitions.

The key words here are "great" and "amazing," both of which express strong positive emotions. The context is about a football game, which is likely exciting or thrilling for fans. Since the user is expressing enthusiasm and excitement, I should consider what emotion label fits best.

Looking at the guidelines: surprise is mentioned as being similar to distraction or amazement. In this case, "amazing" directly relates to surprise because it's an expression of astonishment or thrill. While joy is also a positive emotion, the use of "amazing" leans more towards surprise rather than general happiness.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion here is surprise.
