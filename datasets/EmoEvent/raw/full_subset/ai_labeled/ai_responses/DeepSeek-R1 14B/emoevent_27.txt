Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Venezuela's crisis. The tweet says, "#Venezuela Correcting manipulation. Armoured car RUN OVER helpless citizens." There's also a link included, but since I can't click on it, I'll focus on the text.

First, let me break down the words used. "Correcting manipulation" suggests that something is being揭露 or stopped, which might indicate frustration or anger. The use of "RUN OVER" in all caps emphasizes the action and adds intensity. The phrase "helpless citizens" implies vulnerability and harm, which could evoke strong emotions.

Looking at the context provided, there's a political crisis with two sides: Maduro and Guaido. The tweet seems to be highlighting an event where armored cars are running over people, which is a violent act. This kind of action would likely cause fear or horror in the general public.

The emotion here isn't just anger because it's not directly骂ing someone but describing a harmful action. It's more about the reaction to such an event—fear for the safety of citizens and possibly dread about the ongoing crisis. The use of "RUN OVER" is alarming, which points towards fear or maybe even surprise if this information is new.

But considering the context of a prolonged crisis, it's more likely that the emotion is fear because people are in danger, and the situation is tense. Alternatively, it could be sadness due to the suffering involved, but the strong action described leans more towards fear.

I think the primary emotion here is fear because the tweet highlights a violent act that endangers innocent people, which would naturally evoke fear in the reader.
