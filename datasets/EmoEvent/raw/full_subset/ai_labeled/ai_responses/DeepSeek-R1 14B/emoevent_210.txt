Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet. The tweet says, "Never Forget the Useful Idiots who colluded w/ Socialist Tyranny #Venezuela." Let me break it down.

First, the phrase "Useful Idiots" is a term that's often used to describe people who are manipulated into supporting something harmful without realizing it. Using this term here suggests frustration or annoyance towards those individuals. The word "colluded" implies collaboration with something negativeâ€”Socialist Tyranny in this case. So, the author is expressing disapproval and maybe anger towards these people.

The hashtag #Venezuela adds context about the ongoing political crisis there. Given that Venezuela has been in a state of tension regarding its leadership since 2019, the tweet likely reflects the author's stance on the situation. The tone here isn't positive; it's more critical and derogatory towards those supporting or involved with what the author perceives as tyranny.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: if the emotion is similar to annoyance or rage, classify it as anger. Here, "Useful Idiots" definitely carries a negative connotation, showing irritation or frustration towards certain individuals. There's no indication of fear, joy, sadness, disgust (as in dislike), or surprise. The primary emotion seems to be anger directed at those seen as idiots for supporting socialist tyranny.

So, putting it all together, the tweet is expressing anger towards people who are perceived negatively in this context.
