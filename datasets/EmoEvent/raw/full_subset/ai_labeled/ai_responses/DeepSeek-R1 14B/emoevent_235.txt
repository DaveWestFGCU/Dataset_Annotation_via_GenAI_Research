Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The tweet says, "Finding a minute to read a book for 'fun' is self-care. #WorldBookDay." 

First, let's break down the content. The author mentions taking time to read a book for fun and refers to it as self-care. Reading for fun usually brings relaxation and enjoyment. Self-care often implies taking time to do something that benefits one's well-being or happiness.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: joy is associated with serenity or ecstasy, which seems related to finding pleasure in an activity like reading. The tweet doesn't show any negative emotions like anger or sadness; instead, it's positive and uplifting.

So, considering all this, the primary emotion here is joy because the author is expressing happiness from engaging in a enjoyable activity as part of self-care.
