Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says, "So Arya single-handedly saved the world? My fucking queen #GameOfThrones." 

First, let's break down the content. The user is talking about Arya saving the world on her own. They use the phrase "My fucking queen," which seems like a strong reaction. The word "fucking" here is often used to express intense emotion, usually anger or frustration, but it can also be used in a positive context as an exclamation.

Looking at the structure of the tweet, they're expressing admiration for Arya's actions. The use of "queen" is clearly a term of endearment or praise. So even though there's a strong word, the overall tone seems to be one of excitement and approval rather than anger or frustration.

Considering the emotion mapping guidelines: if it's similar to annoyance or rage, it's anger. But here, the user isn't expressing anger; they're more in awe. The phrase "My fucking queen" is likely an ejaculation of surprise and admiration. 

So, looking at the options, surprise fits because the user seems surprised by Arya's actions and is expressing amazement. Alternatively, joy could be considered since they're praising her, but the primary emotion here feels more like surprise due to the exclamation and the context of something unexpected happening in the show.

Therefore, I think the emotion conveyed is surprise.
