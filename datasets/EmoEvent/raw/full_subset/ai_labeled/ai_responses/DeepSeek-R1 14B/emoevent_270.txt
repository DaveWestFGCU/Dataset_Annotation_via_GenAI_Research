Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. The user is asking me to classify it into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, let me read the tweet carefully. It says, "Thrilling to see Venezuelans rise from the oppression of Socialism. Freedom is the natural condition of mankind. If it is not given by government it will be demanded by the people. By sword, if necessary. Patriots in America are with you, #Venezuela https://t.co/sTudUp1H1L"

The word "thrilling" stands out to me right at the beginning. That's a strong positive emotion. The author is expressing excitement and enthusiasm about Venezuelans rising against socialism. They're talking about freedom being natural and the people demanding it, even using force if needed. This shows determination and support.

Looking at the context provided, there's a crisis in Venezuela regarding who is the legitimate president. The tweet seems to align with those supporting Juan Guaido over Nicolas Maduro, given the mention of rising against oppression and seeking freedom.

The emotions associated with "thrilling" are likely joy because it conveys excitement and support for a cause they believe in. There's no indication of anger or fear here; instead, it's more about positive reinforcement and solidarity.

So, considering all this, the primary emotion is joy.
