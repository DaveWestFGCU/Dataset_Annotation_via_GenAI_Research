Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says, "Sun Tzu is still turning in his grave because of the stupid battle tactics in that #GameofThrones episode both from the defenders and attackers." 

First, let's break down the content. Sun Tzu was a military strategist, so comparing him to the situation implies criticism of the battle strategies shown. The word "stupid" is clearly negative, indicating frustration or disappointment. The phrase "turning in his grave" suggests that even after death, he's upset about how things were handled.

The tweet is pointing out what the author perceives as poor planning on both sidesâ€”defenders and attackers. This indicates a strong negative reaction towards the tactics used in the episode. The use of words like "stupid" and the reference to Sun Tzu being disappointed shows that the author feels annoyed or frustrated with the situation.

Looking at the mapping guidelines, if the emotion is similar to annoyance or rage, it should be classified as anger. While "annoyance" might not be as strong as "rage," it still falls under the umbrella of anger in this context because the tweet expresses clear dissatisfaction and frustration.

I don't think it's disgust because there's no indication of dislike towards a person or object per se, but rather disappointment with strategic decisions. Fear isn't applicable here since there's no sense of dread or anxiety. Joy and surprise are clearly not present; the tone is negative. Sadness might be considered if it were expressing grief, but this seems more about frustration.

So, putting it all together, the primary emotion here is anger due to the frustration and criticism expressed in the tweet.
