Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion conveyed in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. Let me start by reading the tweet carefully.

The tweet says: "#Venezuela The only thing you do not provide peace in Venezuela is that the world is now becoming a blood-sucking vampire America #Venezuela https://t.co/ADcYLChK4H"

Hmm, breaking this down. The user is talking about Venezuela's lack of peace and refers to the world as a "blood-sucking vampire America." That metaphor seems pretty strong. Using words like "vampire" suggests something negative and perhaps something sucking the life out of them.

The context given mentions that there's been a crisis since January 2019 regarding who is the legitimate president, with support split between Maduro and Guaido. So the tweet might be expressing frustration or anger towards how the situation is being handled, possibly blaming external forces like America.

Looking at the emotion mapping guidelines: If it's similar to annoyance or rage, classify as anger. The use of strong metaphors and the mention of "blood-sucking" could indicate a feeling of being victimized or controlled, which might stem from frustration or anger towards those perceived as causing the crisis.

I don't see any signs of disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise in this tweet. It's more about expressing dissatisfaction and frustration with the situation, pointing fingers at America. So the primary emotion here is likely anger.
