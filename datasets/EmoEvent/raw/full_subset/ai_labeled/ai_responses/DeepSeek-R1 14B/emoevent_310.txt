Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user says they're "emotionally wrecked" after watching it, which sounds like a strong emotional response. They also mention being busy over the weekend, comparing their reaction to that. Using words like "wrecked" and exclamation marks shows excitement or maybe even joy because they're expressing how much the show affected them positively. So I think the emotion here is joy.
