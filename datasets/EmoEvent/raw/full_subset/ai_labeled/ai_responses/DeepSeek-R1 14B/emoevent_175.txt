Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet. The tweet says, "Messi just loves demolishing English teams! #ChampionsLeague." Let me break it down.

First, Messi is mentioned, and he's known for being a great footballer. The word "loves" here shows that he has a strong positive feeling towards something. In this case, it's about demolishing English teams. Demolishing usually means destroying or defeating them thoroughly.

So the emotion here seems to be joy because Messi is enjoying the act of defeating these teams. There's no indication of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise. It's more about the pleasure he gets from winning against them in the Champions League context.
