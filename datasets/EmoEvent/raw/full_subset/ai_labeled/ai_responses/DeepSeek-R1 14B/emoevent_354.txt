Okay, so I need to figure out the primary emotion in this tweet about the Champions League game. The user wrote, "what a game USER USER USER! Lived up to the hype and expectation of the game. Hoping for the 2nd leg to be as exciting as this! #ChampionsLeague #BARLIV". 

First, I notice that they're using exclamation marks which usually indicate strong emotions. The words "what a game" suggest excitement or amazement. They mention that it lived up to hype and expectations, which implies it was thrilling. Also, they express hope for the second leg to be as exciting, showing eagerness and positive anticipation.

Looking at the emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet doesn't show any negative emotions like anger or disgust. There's no fear or anxiety mentioned. Sadness isn't present either. The user is clearly expressing excitement and enthusiasm, which aligns with joy. They seem thrilled about the game and looking forward to more.

So, considering all this, the emotion here is joy because they're expressing happiness and excitement about the game.
