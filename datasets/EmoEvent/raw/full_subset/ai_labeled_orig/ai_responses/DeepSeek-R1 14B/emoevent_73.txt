Okay, I need to classify this tweet's emotion based on the given categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

First, let's read the tweet carefully:

"USER USER USER_comin USER Oh yes it will, disappointingly, as have all of the other injustices against the Catalan government and people. Nothing will happen until the EU practices what it preaches. Like #GretaThunberg"

Breaking this down: The user is talking about disappointment with injustices against the Catalan government and people. They express that nothing will change unless the EU follows its principles, similar to Greta Thunberg's stance on climate action.

The key words here are "disappointingly," which directly points to sadness or disappointment. The overall tone seems negative but not necessarily angry or fearful. There's a sense of resignation and unhappiness about the current situation.

Greta Thunberg is mentioned, known for her passionate advocacy, but in this context, it's more about highlighting the lack of action rather than expressing anger towards her.

So, considering the emotion categories, "disappointingly" fits best under sadness. There's no evident expression of anger (like strong verbs or frustration), disgust (no negative moral judgment), fear (no threats or anxieties), joy, or surprise.

**sadness**

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion the author intended. The tweet is: "Oh yes it will, disappointingly, as have all of the other injustices against the Catalan government and people. Nothing will happen until the EU practices what it preaches. Like #GretaThunberg."

First, I should read through the tweet carefully to understand its content and tone. The author starts with "Oh yes it will," which seems a bit sarcastic or resigned. Then they mention that nothing will happen until the EU practices what it preaches. This suggests frustration or disappointment.

The use of "disappointingly" in the beginning directly indicates that the emotion is likely sadness or maybe some level of disappointment, which falls under sadness. The author is expressing a sense of resignation and sorrow about the situation regarding the Catalan government and people facing injustices. 

Greta Thunberg's movement is about climate change activism, so by tagging her, the author might be drawing a parallel between the lack of effective EU action and Greta's stance on governments not taking enough climate action. This could imply that the author sees a similar pattern of disappointment in both situations.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger involves annoyance or rage, disgust is more about dislike, fear involves anxiety, joy is positive feelings, surprise is unexpected events. The tweet isn't expressing any of those except sadness, especially with words like "disappointingly" and the overall tone suggesting resignation and sorrow over inaction.

**sadness**

Alright, so I've got this query where I need to classify a tweet's emotion based on Greta Thunberg's context. Let me break it down.

First, the user provided some background about Greta Thunberg and her Fridays for Future movement. They're asking to classify a specific tweet into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Looking at the tweet: "Oh yes it will, disappointingly, as have all of the other injustices against the Catalan government and people. Nothing will happen until the EU practices what it preaches. Like #GretaThunberg"

The author is talking about how Catalonia's issues won't be resolved unless the EU follows through on its preachings. They express disappointment and mention that this mirrors past injustices. The word "disappointingly" stands out hereâ€”it clearly indicates dissatisfaction or letdown, which falls under sadness.

I should consider other emotions too. Is there any anger? Maybe frustration is involved, but the primary emotion seems to be sadness due to the disappointment expressed. There's no evident disgust, fear, joy, or surprise in the tweet.

So, the most fitting emotion here is sadness because of the explicit mention of disappointment and the overall tone of disillusionment.

**sadness**
