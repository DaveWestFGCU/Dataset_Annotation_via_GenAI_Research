Alright, let's break down this query. The user has provided a tweet about Luis Suarez scoring a goal and someone named Alba being the best left-back, along with some hashtags related to Barcelona and the Champions League.

First, I need to classify the emotion in the tweet using only the specified categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

Looking at the tweet, it starts with "Luis Suarez 1-0!" which sounds like a goal. The exclamation mark suggests excitement. Then there's a thumbs-up emoji üëè, often used to show approval or celebration. 

The phrase "Best left back in the world" is a compliment, indicating admiration for Alba's performance. The hashtags #Bar√ßaLFC and #ChampionsLeague are related to football and the competition, which adds context about passion for the sport.

Considering the emotion categories, anger doesn't fit because there's no indication of frustration or irritation. Disgust isn't present either; instead, there's positive sentiment. Fear is also out of place since there's nothing suggesting anxiety or dread. Sadness isn't applicable here because the tweet seems upbeat.

The use of emojis and celebratory language points towards joy. The author is expressing happiness about a goal and praise for a player, which falls under the joy category.
