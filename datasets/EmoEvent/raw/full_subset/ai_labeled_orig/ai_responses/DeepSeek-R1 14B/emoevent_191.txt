Alright, I need to classify the given tweet's emotion from the specified list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

Looking at the tweet: "So Arya single-handedly saved the world? My fucking queen #GameOf Thrones"

The author is expressing a strong positive sentiment towards Arya. Using words like "single-handedly" and "saved the world" highlights admiration. The phrase "My fucking queen" adds emphasis, indicating enthusiasm or excitement.

Considering the emotion categories, joy fits because it's about happiness and celebration of her actions. No signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise are present here.

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion is conveyed in this tweet: "So Arya single-handedly saved the world? My fucking queen #GameOfThrones". The possible emotions are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. 

First, let me break down the sentence. The user starts with a statement about Arya saving the world on her own. Then they say "My fucking queen" and tag Game of Thrones. 

The phrase "my fucking queen" seems like praise because "fucking queen" is often used as an exclamation of admiration or disbelief, sometimes with a mix of awe and humor. The mention of Arya saving the world suggests something impressive happened, which would likely evoke positive emotions.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger doesn't fit because there's no indication of frustration or rage. Disgust isn't here either; the tone is more admiring than disliking. Fear? No, the user seems excited rather than scared. Sadness isn't present since the tweet is about a positive achievement. Surprise could be possible if they're amazed, but the stronger emotion seems to be joy because of the praise and admiration.

So, putting it together, the author is expressing joy through their words.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The tweet is, "So Arya single-handedly saved the world? My fucking queen #GameOfThrones."

First, let's break down what the tweet is saying. The user is talking about Arya Stark from Game of Thrones, who they're referring to as a "my fucking queen." The exclamation "fucking" often conveys strong emotion, but I need to figure out which one.

The phrase "single-handedly saved the world" sounds like a significant accomplishment. Using words like "queen" is clearly a term of endearment or admiration. The word "fucking" here isn't necessarily anger; it's more likely being used as an intensifier, similar to saying "heck." So, it's amplifying the praise rather than expressing frustration.

Looking at the emotion categories:
- Anger: Doesn't seem right because there's no indication of irritation or rage.
- Disgust: No signs of dislike or disinterest here.
- Fear: There's nothing suggesting worry or anxiety.
- Joy/Serenity: This seems possible because the user is expressing pride and amazement at Arya's actions.
- Sadness: Doesn't fit; there's no sorrow expressed.
- Surprise: While surprise could be a contender, it often involves unexpected events. Here, the user is reacting to a known event (the show finale) with excitement rather than shock.

So, putting it together, the emotion conveyed is joy because of the praise and admiration directed at Arya.
