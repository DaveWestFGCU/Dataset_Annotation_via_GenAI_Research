Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to classify a tweet based on the emotion conveyed, choosing from six categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully: "Theon's character has such a great arc, always ran from death until the end. Hero #GameofThrones." The user is talking about Theon's journey in Game of Thrones, highlighting that he consistently avoided death throughout his story. They describe him as a hero.

Breaking down the sentiment here, the author is clearly expressing positive feelings towards Theon. Words like "great arc" and "Hero" are strong indicators of approval or admiration. There's no negative language or signs of distress; instead, it's celebratory in tone.

Now, looking at the emotion categories, joy seems to fit best. Joy includes serenity and ecstasy, which align with feelings of pride or satisfaction about Theon's character development. While there might be some elements of surprise in his journey, the primary emotion here is praise and positive sentiment, making joy the most appropriate label.

I should ensure that I'm not considering any other emotions like anger or disgust because the tweet isn't expressing negative feelings towards the show or its characters. The focus is on Theon's heroism and the strength of his storyline, which leans heavily into joy.

Alright, so I need to figure out the emotion in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says, "Theon's character has such a great arc, always ran from death until the end. Hero #GameofThrones." 

First, let me break down the words used. "Great arc" suggests that the user is talking about a significant and meaningful journey for Theon. They mention he "always ran from death until the end," which indicates that Theon's character development was focused on his interactions with death throughout the series.

The word "Hero" at the end stands out. It seems like the author is praising Theon, calling him a hero. This implies admiration or respect for how Theon handled his fears and challenges.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet doesn't show any signs of anger or disgust. There's no indication of fear unless it's about Theon's character being afraid, but the overall tone is positive. Sadness isn't there either because they're highlighting a positive aspect.

The use of "great" and "Hero" points towards joy or serenity, as the author seems pleased with Theon's development. There's no element of surprise in this tweet; it's more about appreciation than something unexpected.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed here is likely joy because the author is expressing positive feelings and admiration for Theon's character arc.
