Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to classify a tweet into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. 

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says, "Ok guys, I watched all 7 seasons of #GameofThrones and the 3 new episodes all in a span of a month. Safe to say I’m a fan now." 

Breaking this down, the user mentions watching all seven seasons plus three new episodes in just a month. The key phrase here is "Safe to say I'm a fan now." This indicates that the person has developed a strong interest or liking for Game of Thrones after consuming a lot of content quickly.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger isn't present because there's no frustration or irritation expressed. Disgust also doesn't fit; the user isn't expressing dislike or aversion. Fear is absent too—there’s no indication of anxiety or terror.

Now, considering joy: The user expresses enthusiasm about becoming a fan after watching all the content. This suggests happiness and satisfaction, which falls under joy. Sadness isn't applicable here because there's no sorrow or grief mentioned. Surprise could be considered if something unexpected happened, but in this case, the person is simply stating their new fandom.

So, the emotion conveyed is joy because the user is expressing excitement and eagerness after immersing themselves in the series.

The tweet expresses **joy**, as the author shows enthusiasm and satisfaction about becoming a fan of Game of Thrones after watching all seasons. 

**joy**

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion conveyed. The tweet is: "Ok guys, I watched all 7 seasons of #GameofThrones and the 3 new episodes all in a span of a month. Safe to say I'm a fan now." 

First, let me read through it carefully. The person mentions watching all 7 seasons plus three new episodes in a month. That's a lot! They conclude by saying they're a fan now. So, the emotion here is likely positive because they are expressing that they became a fan after watching everything.

Looking at the possible emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to pick the most relevant one from these categories.

"Safe to say I'm a fan now." This sounds like a statement of excitement or satisfaction. They probably feel happy about completing all the seasons and becoming a fan. So, joy seems appropriate here because they're expressing a positive emotion after achieving something they set out to do—watching the entire series.

I don't think it's surprise because there's no indication of being unexpectedly thrilled. It's more about the accomplishment and enjoyment leading to becoming a fan. Fear or anxiety isn't present. Disgust or anger is also not applicable here since the tweet doesn't express any negative feelings.

So, joy fits best as the emotion conveyed.
