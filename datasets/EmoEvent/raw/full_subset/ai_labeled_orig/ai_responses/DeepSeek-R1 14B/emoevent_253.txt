Alright, I need to classify the emotion in this tweet: "Come on really tho THAT FREE KICK!!!!!! üêê talk #Messi #ChampionsLeague". Let me break it down.

First, the user is expressing strong emotions with multiple exclamation marks and emojis. The phrase "Come on really tho" suggests disbelief or surprise. They're reacting to a free kick, which in football can be a surprising moment, especially if it's well-taken or significant. 

The emoji used is üêê, which I recognize as a reference to the goat meme, often associated with shock or disbelief ("That's wild"). This reinforces the idea that the user is surprised.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger involves annoyance or rage, disgust is about dislike, fear is anxiety or terror, joy includes happiness, sadness is grief, and surprise covers amazement. Here, the reaction isn't frustration (anger) but more about being amazed by the free kick moment.

So, putting it together, the emotion conveyed is **surprise**.

The tweet expresses shock or amazement at a remarkable event during a Champions League match, likely involving Messi's impressive skill.

Okay, I need to classify the emotion of this tweet: "Come on really tho THAT FREE KICK!!!!!! üêê talk #Messi #ChampionsLeague". Let me break it down.

First, looking at the text. The user is clearly reacting to a free kick, which in football (soccer) can be a big moment, especially if it's from a top player like Messi. They're using multiple exclamation marks and the word "tho" which sounds casual but adds emphasis.

The emoji used is üêê, which I think refers to goats. Wait, maybe that's part of an acronym or slang? Sometimes in sports, goats are used humorously. Maybe it's a playful way to express frustration or disbelief.

Putting it together: the user seems surprised and possibly a bit annoyed or frustrated at the outcome of the free kick. They're reacting strongly, using lots of exclamation marks, which indicates high emotion.

Looking at the options: anger includes annoyance, so that fits if they're frustrated. Surprise is about shock or amazement, but I think the primary emotion here is more frustration rather than pure surprise.

So, the emotion conveyed is probably "anger" because of the strong reaction and the use of a goat emoji which might be a playful way to express dislike or frustration.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion. The tweet is: "Come on really tho THAT FREE KICK!!!!!! üêê talk #Messi #ChampionsLeague". Let me break it down.

First, the user starts with "Come on really tho", which sounds like they're expressing disbelief or surprise. They seem shocked that something happened‚Äîprobably a free kick by Messi in the Champions League. The use of multiple exclamation marks and the word "tho" emphasizes their astonishment.

The emoji üêê is interesting. It's a goat, but I know sometimes on social media, goats are used as a meme or to express frustration, especially when someone is being overly dramatic. But in this context, since it's paired with surprise-related words, maybe it's just adding emphasis or humor rather than indicating disgust.

The hashtags #Messi and #ChampionsLeague point towards football (soccer) talk, likely about Messi taking a free kick that might have been impressive or unexpected. The overall tone seems more about the astonishment of the moment rather than any negative emotion like anger or disgust.

So putting it all together: The user is surprised by Messi's free kick, using exclamations and a goat emoji to convey their shock. There‚Äôs no indication of anger, fear, sadness, or disgust‚Äîjust pure surprise.
