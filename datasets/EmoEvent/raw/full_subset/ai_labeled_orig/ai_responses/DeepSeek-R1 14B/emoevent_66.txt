First, I'll break it down. The author is talking about World Book Day and how it's the perfect place to pitch their book. They mention it's a sci-fi adventure with 93k words, which sounds like a significant achievement. Then they list elements of their story: War, Aliens, Spaceships, difficulty explaining sexuality, Climate change.

Looking at the tone, they seem enthusiastic about their work and excited about the opportunity to pitch. The exclamation points after each element suggest excitement and maybe a sense of pride in the book's content. They're highlighting various aspects to show that their book is comprehensive and appealing.

There are no negative words here; instead, it's all positive and energetic. The hashtags they used also seem professional but not necessarily emotionalâ€”more about networking and promotion. However, the overall vibe is someone who is happy with their accomplishment and eager to share it.

So considering the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet doesn't show any negative emotions or fear. It's more about excitement and happiness about their book and the platform to pitch it. So joy seems like the right category here.
