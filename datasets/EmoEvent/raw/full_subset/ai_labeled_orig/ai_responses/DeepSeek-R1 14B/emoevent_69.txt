Okay, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion it conveys. The user starts by mentioning World Book Day and their job at USER. They talk about making progress in an extraordinary novel with 1136 pages read so far and only 325 left. They also reference being a theatre kid at USER, specifically at "A Little Fall of Rain," and include a link.

The tone seems positive because they're celebrating World Book Day, reading a lengthy book, and sharing their progress. The mention of theater adds a personal touch but doesn't indicate any negative emotion. There's no sign of anger, disgust, fear, or surprise; instead, it's more about accomplishment and joy in reading and their job.
