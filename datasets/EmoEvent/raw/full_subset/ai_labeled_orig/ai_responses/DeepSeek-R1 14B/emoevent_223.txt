Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to classify this tweet into one of the given emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me read the tweet carefully.

The tweet says, "Absolutely wrong! #Guaido won the election. He's the rightly elected President. Shame on you, Jim Sciutto. #Maduro #Venezuela." 

First, I notice the user is expressing strong disagreement. They're calling someone else "absolutely wrong," which indicates frustration or anger. The use of "shame on you" also adds to that sentiment; it's a reproachful statement.

The mention of Guaido winning the election and being the rightful president suggests the user supports him, possibly against Maduro. This strong stance and the confrontational tone likely stem from anger rather than other emotions like disgust or fear.

There are no words indicating fear or anxiety about the situation, so it's not fear. The language isn't positive or serene, so joy is out of the question. Sadness would imply sorrow, but the user seems more frustrated than sad. Surprise would require an unexpected event, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

Therefore, the emotion conveyed is primarily anger due to the confrontational and assertive language used.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out what emotion the author of this tweet is conveying. Let me look at the tweet closely.

The user starts with "Absolutely wrong!" which immediately sounds like they're upset or annoyed. They mention that Guaido won the election and is the rightful president, so they're supporting him. Then they say "Shame on you, Jim Sciutto." That definitely sounds like they're calling someone out, probably because they disagree with what Sciutto said.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger includes annoyance and rage. The use of "Absolutely wrong" and "Shame on you" suggests frustration or anger towards someone else's viewpoint. There's no indication of disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise here. It's more about expressing strong disagreement rather than any other emotion.

So, the primary emotion here is anger because the user is correcting someone and showing irritation with their stance.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion it conveys. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me look at the tweet again: "Absolutely wrong! #Guaido won the election. He's the rightly elected President. Shame on you, Jim Sciutto.  #Maduro #Venezuela"

The user is expressing strong disagreement with someone named Jim Sciutto. They're calling them "absolutely wrong" and using phrases like "shame on you." This seems more than just mild annoyance; it's a clear expression of frustration or anger. The mention of Guaido being the rightfully elected president suggests that the user feels strongly about this issue, possibly due to political beliefs.

I don't see any elements of disgust here unless the user is disgusted by Sciutto's stance, but the primary emotion seems to be directed at correcting what they perceive as a wrong statement. The use of strong language like "Absolutely wrong" and "Shame on you" points towards anger rather than other emotions. There's no indication of fear or surprise; it's more about expressing disapproval and frustration.

So, putting it all together, the emotion here is clearly anger.
