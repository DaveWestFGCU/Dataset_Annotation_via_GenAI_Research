Okay, I need to classify this tweet's emotion from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

The tweet says: "THAT EPISODE WAS FUCKING EVERYTHING... 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 #GameofThrones SHAKING. 😱😱😱😱😱"

First, I notice the use of strong language like "FUCKING EVERYTHING," which indicates some negative emotion, likely anger or frustration.

The emojis used are 🤯 and 😱. 🤯 usually represents shock or surprise, while 😱 is also a shocked or amazed face. 

Looking at the words, "SHAKING" suggests the person is surprised or overwhelmed. The repetition of emojis emphasizes strong emotions.

Putting it all together, the author seems to be expressing shock and surprise about the episode's content, possibly because it was unexpected or intense.

The tweet uses strong language and shocked emojis, indicating surprise.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a tweet about the Game of Thrones series and wants it classified into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says, "THAT EPISODE WAS FUCKING EVERYTHING... 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 #GameofThrones SHAKING. 😱😱😱️😱". The user is clearly expressing strong emotions with the words and emojis used.

Breaking it down, the phrase "fucking everything" indicates a high level of frustration or anger. The repeated emojis like 🤯 and 😱 suggest shock and disbelief. So, I need to figure out which emotion category this falls into.

Looking at the options, anger is one possibility because of the strong language used. However, the use of emojis like 🤯 (which means being shocked) and 😱 (surprise or fear) might point more towards surprise. But wait, surprise also includes amazement and distraction.

Wait, but sometimes shock can be a mix of fear or surprise. However, in this context, the primary emotion seems to be frustration and anger because they're using profanity and reacting strongly to the episode's content. The emojis are showing their reaction to how unexpected or disappointing it was, which might tie into both surprise and anger.

But according to the classification, each emotion is a broad category. So I need to pick the most dominant one. Since "fucking everything" is a strong expression of frustration, that leans towards anger. However, the emojis are more about shock and surprise, so maybe surprise is the intended emotion.

Wait again, perhaps the user is expressing both anger and surprise, but since we have to choose only one from the list, I need to see which fits better. The exclamation and the hashtags might indicate that the user is overwhelmed with how the episode turned out, which could be more about shock or surprise.

But then, sometimes when people are angry, they express it as "fucking" something, so maybe the primary emotion here is anger. Alternatively, if the tweet is about being surprised by the outcome, then it's surprise.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The user says "THAT EPISODE WAS FUCKING EVERYTHING... 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 #GameofThrones SHAKING. 😱😱️😱". So they're using multiple shock emojis and also the shaking emoji. The use of multiple shock faces suggests surprise, but the wording "fucking everything" indicates anger.

Hmm, maybe it's a combination, but I have to choose one. In sentiment analysis, sometimes strong reactions can be either anger or surprise depending on context. Here, since they're reacting to an episode's content that likely didn't meet their expectations, perhaps the primary emotion is surprise because of the shock and disbelief.

Wait no, if it's a negative reaction, maybe it's more anger. But surprise can also be negative when someone is shocked by something bad happening. So I'm torn between anger and surprise.

Looking at the emotion definitions: surprise includes amazement and distraction, which could fit the emojis used. Anger includes annoyance and rage, which fits the strong language. But since the user is reacting to an unexpected event (the episode), maybe surprise is more appropriate.

Alternatively, they might be expressing both but I have to choose one. Given that the primary emotion seems to be shock and disbelief about how the episode ended, I think surprise is the right classification.

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion the author of this tweet is conveying. The tweet says: "THAT EPISODE WAS FUCKING EVERYTHING... 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 #GameofThrones SHAKING. 😱😱😱😱😱". 

First, let me break down the components of the tweet. The user starts with an exclamation about the episode being "fucking everything," which is a strong negative statement. They follow it up with several emojis: 🤯 repeated five times and 😱 also repeated five times. 

Looking at the words alone, "fucking everything" suggests frustration or anger, but the use of multiple exclamation points might indicate more than just anger—it could be a mix of surprise or shock as well. The emojis used are 🤯, which represents face palms or confusion, and 😱, which is an expression of shock or surprise.

The hashtags don't add much in terms of emotion—they're just tagging the show for relevance.

So, considering the emotions list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The words convey strong negative feelings but also a sense of astonishment. The emojis used are more about surprise— zwłaszcza 😱 which is shock. While "fucking everything" might lean towards anger or frustration, the emphasis seems to be on how shocking or surprising the episode was.

I think the key here is the use of the 😱 emoji, which directly corresponds to surprise. Even though there's frustration in the wording, the overall impact the tweet is trying to convey is that the episode was so shocking it left them shaking.
