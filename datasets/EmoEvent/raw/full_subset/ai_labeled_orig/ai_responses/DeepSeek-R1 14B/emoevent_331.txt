Alright, let's break down this query. The user provided a tweet and wants it classified into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It mentions USA donating millions to rebuild Notre-Dame Cathedral after the fire, while Puerto Rico isn't getting enough donations without criticism from Trump's administration. Also, kids in the US can't have certain classes, and the user ends with "sad!!! ðŸ™ƒ"

The hashtags like #NotreDameCathedralFire and the exclamation mark indicate frustration or disappointment. The use of "sad" explicitly points towards sadness.

I should consider if there's any other emotion here. There's some criticism involved, which could hint at anger, but the main sentiment seems to be sadness regarding the lack of support for schools.

**sadness**

Alright, let's try to figure out the emotion behind this tweet. The user is talking about the USA donating millions to rebuild Notre-Dame Cathedral and mentions that Puerto Rico can't get donations without criticism from Trump and his administration. They also point out that kids in the US don't have access to gym, music, Spanish, or second language classes. 

The main sentiment seems to be disappointment or sadness because they're highlighting a contrast between significant donations for Notre-Dame and the lack of support for education and other areas. The use of "sad!!! ðŸ™ƒ" at the end clearly indicates sadness.

The tweet expresses **sadness** as it laments the lack of support for education and criticizes the situation in Puerto Rico while also pointing out issues within the US, alluding to a sense of sorrow or disappointment.

Okay, I need to classify the emotion of this tweet based on the given categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Let me read the tweet carefully.

The tweet starts with hashtags about USA and America donating millions to rebuild Notre-Dame Cathedral after the fire. Then it mentions Puerto Rico and how American can't get more donations without criticism from Trump and his administration. It also points out that kids in the US can't have gym, music, Spanish, or any second language classes, ending with "sad!!! ðŸ™ƒ" and a link.

The author is expressing frustration about the priorities of donating to Notre-Dame while neglecting local needs in Puerto Rico and U.S. schools. The word "sad!!!" explicitly shows sadness. They're probably feeling down because they think resources are being misplaced. Even though there's some criticism implied, which could hint at anger, the primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the explicit use of the word and the context about neglected local issues.

The tweet expresses frustration and disappointment regarding funding priorities, but the dominant emotion conveyed is **sadness** due to the mention of neglecting local needs.

**sadness**
