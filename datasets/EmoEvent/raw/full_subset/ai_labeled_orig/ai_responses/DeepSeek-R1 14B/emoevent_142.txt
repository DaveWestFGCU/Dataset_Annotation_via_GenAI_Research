Alright, I need to classify this tweet into one of the given emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

The tweet says something about a user sending a message to the Cuban regime for meddling in Venezuela and accuses Cuba of playing a direct role in the crisis. The word "meddling" has negative connotations, implying interference that's not welcome. Accusing someone suggests frustration or anger.

I should consider the emotion behind the words. Using terms like "accusing" and "direct role" might indicate anger rather than disgust because it's more about blame and frustration. There's no expression of surprise or fear here; instead, it seems directed with intent to convey disapproval.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a tweet and asked me to classify it into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. 

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says: "#Breaking 》 USER sending a special message to the Cuban regime for meddling in #Venezuela accusing #Cuba of playing direct role in this man made crisis." So, the author is addressing Cuba's involvement in Venezuela's crisis.

I need to determine the emotion conveyed here. The key words are "meddling" and "accusing," which often carry negative connotations. Meddling implies interfering in a way that's not welcome, suggesting frustration or anger. Accusing someone directly can also be seen as confrontational, which might indicate anger.

Looking at the context of Venezuela's crisis, it's a tense situation with opposing sides supporting different leaders. The tweet seems to指责 Cuba for getting involved, possibly fueling existing tensions. This kind of direct accusation usually comes from a place of anger rather than other emotions like disgust or fear.

I should consider if any other emotion fits better. Disgust is more about feeling something is unpleasant, but here the focus is on blaming and confronting. Fear would imply anxiety or dread, which doesn't seem to be the case here. Joy and surprise are clearly not applicable given the context of conflict.

So, putting it all together, the author's main emotion is likely anger due to the accusatory tone and the implication of frustration with Cuba's involvement.

Alright, let's try to figure out what emotion is behind this tweet. The user is talking about a special message being sent to the Cuban regime for meddling in Venezuela and accuses Cuba of playing a direct role in the crisis. 

First, I need to understand the context. The crisis they're referring to is about who is the legitimate President of Venezuela—Nicolas Maduro or Juan Guaido. This has been ongoing since January 2019 and is causing a lot of division both within Venezuela and globally.

Looking at the tweet, it's addressing Cuba for interfering in Venezuela's affairs. The user seems to be pointing fingers at Cuba, suggesting they are meddling and directly involved in creating or exacerbating the crisis. 

The emotion here might be frustration or anger because the user is accusing another country of interfering. They're not just stating facts but expressing a strong stance against Cuban involvement. There's an element of blame and perhaps a call to action against this interference.

I need to choose from the given emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The options here don't include frustration directly, but it's close to anger. The user isn't expressing fear or sadness; they're more confrontational in their tone. Disgust could be a possibility if they feel厌恶 towards Cuba's actions, but the primary emotion seems to be anger—directed at Cuba for their involvement.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed here is likely **anger**.
</think>

The tweet expresses **anger**, as it accuses Cuba of interfering in Venezuela's affairs and playing a direct role in the crisis, showing frustration and blame towards Cuban involvement. 

**Answer:** **anger**
