Alright, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion. The tweet says: "Sun Tzu is still turning in his grave because of the stupid battle tactics in that #GameofThrones episode both from the defenders and attackers." 

First, let me break down the components. Sun Tzu was a military strategist, known for his book "The Art of War," so comparing him to the situation implies a judgment on strategy. The word "stupid" is clearly negative, indicating frustration or disappointment.

The author mentions both defenders and attackers having poor tactics, which shows a strong dislike or disapproval. The overall tone seems critical, pointing out what they perceive as incompetence in battle planning. 

Looking at the emotion categories: anger includes annoyance and rage. Disgust involves dislike and disinterest. Here, the use of "stupid" suggests more frustration rather than pure disgust. The focus is on poor tactics leading to negative outcomes, which aligns with anger rather than disgust.

There's no indication of fear, joy, sadness, or surprise in the tweet. It's directed at criticizing the tactics, so the emotion conveyed is likely anger.

The tweet expresses frustration and disappointment regarding the battle tactics, fitting under the category of **anger**.

**emotion**
- anger

Alright, let's break this down. The user wants me to classify a tweet based on emotion using specific categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

The tweet is about Sun Tzu being upset over battle tactics in Game of Thrones. The word "stupid" and the mention of both defenders and attackers having bad strategies suggests frustration.

Frustration often falls under anger because it's a form of irritation or annoyance. So I think the emotion here is anger.

Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion the author intended to convey in this tweet. The tweet says: "Sun Tzu is still turning in his grave because of the stupid battle tactics in that #GameofThrones episode both from the defenders and attackers." 

First, let's break down what the tweet is saying. Sun Tzu was a famous military strategist, so the author is referencing him to express disapproval about the battle tactics in a Game of Thrones episode. The word "stupid" clearly shows negative feelings towards those tactics.

Now, considering the emotions provided: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. 

The tweet isn't expressing fear or surprise because it's not talking about something unexpected or scary. It's more about disapproval of a situation. Sadness might come into play if someone was upset over losses, but here it seems more frustration-based.

Disgust is another option. Disgust can include dislike and disinterest. The use of "stupid" indicates the author doesn't like what happened in the episode. They're not just sad or annoyed; they're expressing a strong negative emotion towards the tactics used.

Anger could also be a contender because frustration is part of anger, but the primary emotion here seems to be more about disliking something rather than being enraged.

So, between anger and disgust, I think disgust fits better because it's about dislike or disapproval. The author isn't necessarily angry; they're more expressing that they find the tactics stupid, which aligns with disgust.

**disgust**
