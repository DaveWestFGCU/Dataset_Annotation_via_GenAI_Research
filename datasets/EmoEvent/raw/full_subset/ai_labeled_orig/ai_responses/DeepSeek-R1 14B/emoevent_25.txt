Using emotive words like "changed the world" and "fighting for a globalimpact" suggests admiration and respect. The positive tone and choice of hashtags that celebrate activism and empowerment are strong indicators of a positive emotion.

Looking at the options, joy includes serenity and ecstasy but can also encompass pride or inspiration. There's no sign of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise in the tweet. It's all about celebrating their achievements.
