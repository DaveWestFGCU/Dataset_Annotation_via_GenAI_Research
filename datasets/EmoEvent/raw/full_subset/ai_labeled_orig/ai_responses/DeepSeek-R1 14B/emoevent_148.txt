Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a tweet and wants it classified into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says, "Hopefully VOX will be defeated. #SpainElection." So, the author is expressing a wish for the defeat of VOX in the election.

VOX is a Spanish political party known for its right-wing stance and has been controversial. The use of "hopefully" here indicates that the speaker is desiring a positive outcome where VOX loses. 

Now, I need to determine which emotion this conveys. Let's consider each category:

1. **Anger**: While supporting a party's defeat might come from frustration, the tweet itself doesn't express anger directly; it's more of a desire.
2. **Disgust**: The author might feel disgusted by VOX's policies or actions, but the tweet focuses on their hope for defeat rather than explicitly showing disgust.
3. **Fear**: If the speaker fears what VOX could do if elected, fear might be involved, but again, it's more about hoping they lose rather than expressing fear directly.
4. **Joy**: The author is hoping for a positive outcome, which aligns with joy or satisfaction if their desired result occurs. "Hopefully" suggests a positive expectation.
5. **Sadness**: There's no indication of sadness here; instead, the sentiment is more proactive.
6. **Surprise**: No element of surprise in the statement.

The most fitting emotion here seems to be **joy**, as the author is expressing hope for a favorable outcome they desire. It's about wishing for something positive rather than reacting to an event with another emotion like anger or fear.

**joy**

Alright, I need to figure out the emotion behind this tweet: "Hopefully VOX will be defeated. #SpainElection". Let's break it down step by step.

First, the user is expressing a hope that VOX gets defeated in the election. VOX is a political party in Spain known for its far-right stance, so the author likely has negative feelings towards them. The word "Hopefully" indicates a desire or wish for something to happen, which suggests they are hoping for VOX's downfall.

Now, looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to choose the most relevant one.

The tweet isn't filled with rage or annoyance, so it's not primarily about anger. It doesn't express a strong dislike either, though there might be some underlying negativity towards VOX. The main emotion seems more proactive than just disgust.

Fear would imply worry or apprehension, but the author is expressing a positive hope rather than fear of what might happen. Joy isn't applicable here since they're not happy about the situation. Sadness might come into play if they were mourning, but again, it's more about hoping for change.

Surprise doesn't fit because there's no element of unexpectedness in their statement; it's a clear wish.

So, considering all options, the emotion is best categorized under "disgust" because the author likely feels negative or dislikes VOX enough to hope for their defeat. It might not be pure anger but leans more towards dislike or disinterest.

**disgust**

Okay, I need to classify this tweet's emotion. The tweet says, "Hopefully VOX will be defeated. #SpainElection." Let me think about what emotions are involved here.

The user is expressing a desire for VOX to lose in the election. VOX is a political party in Spain, often associated with far-right ideologies. So, when someone hopes a particular party loses, it could indicate several things. Maybe they're worried about the consequences of that party winning, or perhaps they have negative feelings towards VOX's policies or stance.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I don't think it's joy because the user isn't expressing happiness but rather a hope for something bad to happen. Sadness might be involved if they're concerned about the impact of VOX winning, but the primary emotion here seems more like dislike or opposition.

Disgust includes disinterest and dislike. The tweet shows the author doesn't want VOX to succeed, which could stem from disgust with their policies or actions. Alternatively, it might indicate fear if the user is worried about what would happen if VOX wins, but I think the main emotion here is more about opposition due to dislike rather than fear.

So, putting it together, the emotion conveyed is likely disgust because they're hoping for the defeat of a party they probably find repulsive or dislike.

The tweet expresses hope that a political party (VOX) will be defeated in an election. The use of "Hopefully" indicates the author's desire for this outcome, which may stem from opposition to VOX's policies or stance. Considering the emotion categories provided, the most relevant is **disgust**, as it likely reflects disapproval or dislike of VOX.
