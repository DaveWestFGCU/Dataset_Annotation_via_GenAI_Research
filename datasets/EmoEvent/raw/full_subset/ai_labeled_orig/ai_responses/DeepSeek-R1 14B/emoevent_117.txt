Okay, so I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion the author intended. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Let me read the tweet carefully: "The amount of people complaining about people being sad about the Notre Dame is absurdly worrying. Why can't you feel sad that a part of history (and art/architecture not to mention religious to some) has been irreversibly damaged? #NotreDameCathedralFire #NotreDame"

The author is talking about people who are complaining about others being sad over the Notre Dame fire. They find it worrying and express frustration towards those complainers. The main emotion here seems to be frustration, which falls under anger.

They also mention feeling sad because a significant part of history and art has been damaged. But the primary focus is on the act of people not feeling or expressing sadness, which the author finds absurdly worrying. This frustration aligns more with anger rather than sadness itself, as it's about others' lack of empathy.

So, the emotion conveyed is likely anger because of the frustration expressed towards those who aren't moved by the destruction.

The tweet expresses frustration and irritation towards people who are not acknowledging the significance of the Notre Dame fire. This aligns with the emotion of **anger**. 

**Answer:** **anger**

Alright, I need to figure out which emotion the author intended to convey in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let me read the tweet carefully.

The tweet says: "The amount of people complaining about people being sad about the Notre Dame is absurdly worrying. Why can't you feel sad that a part of history (and art/architecture not to mention religious to some) has been irreversibly damaged? #NotreDameCathedralFire #NotreDame"

Okay, so the author is addressing people who are complaining about others being sad over the Notre Dame fire. The author seems frustrated with these complainers and emphasizes why they should feel sad because it's a loss of history, art, architecture, and for some, religion.

Breaking down the emotions: The main emotion here isn't just sadness; the author is expressing frustration towards those who aren't feeling sad. Frustration can relate to anger or annoyance, but I'm not sure if that's the primary emotion intended.

Wait, but looking at the options: anger (includes annoyance), disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet isn't expressing fear or surprise. It's more about the author's reaction to others' lack of empathy.

The author is concerned and upset because people aren't feeling sad about a significant loss. This could be interpreted as frustration or maybe even disgust towards such insensitivity. But I'm not sure if that fits better under anger or disgust.

Alternatively, the primary emotion might be sadness itself because the author is highlighting the importance of feeling sad over the destruction. However, the author's frustration with others' reactions adds another layer.

But the task is to pick the most relevant emotion from the given list based on what the author intended to convey. The tweet is more about the author's reaction to others not sharing their sadness and concern for history's loss. So perhaps the main emotion is sadness, but the frustration could be anger.

Wait, the user is expressing that it's "absurdly worrying" and questions why people can't feel sad. This conveys a sense of disappointment and concern, which might lean towards sadness because the author wants others to share their grief over the loss. However, the use of words like "absurdly worrying" and frustration could point more towards anger.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The tweet is about being upset with people for not feeling sad, so the emotion the author is conveying might be a mix of sadness (over the event) and frustration (with others' reactions). But the options don't allow for multiple emotions; I have to choose one.

Given that, perhaps the primary emotion intended is sadness because the author is trying to evoke empathy and sadness about the loss. The frustration is a secondary reaction towards others, but the main intent is to convey the importance of feeling sad about the event.

Alright, I'm looking at this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user is upset because people are complaining about others being sad over the fire. They express frustration that people aren't feeling sad about such an important lossâ€”part of history, art, architecture, and religion.

The emotions here seem to be more than just sadness. The author isn't just expressing their own grief; they're reacting to others' lack of concern. That sounds like anger or annoyance because the user feels that others are not taking the situation seriously enough. They might feel irritated or upset by what they perceive as insensitivity.

So, I think the main emotion here is anger because it's directed at people for not sharing the same level of concern and sadness about such a significant event.
