Alright, so I need to figure out what emotion is in this tweet about Greta Thunberg and Fridays for Future. Let's see... The user starts by saying "It's always been a meh kind of issue." That "meh" makes me think they're not too excited or positive about it before. Then, they mention that with more youth involved, maybe it's finally getting attention. There's some hope there but also a note of uncertainty because they add "Depends who they asked, of course!" So maybe a bit of doubt.

The next part says they were happy to see it because climate usually never makes the list. The word "happy" is a direct clue pointing towards joy. But let me read further. They use some hashtags like #buzzbuzz and emojis, which often indicate enthusiasm or interest. Also, the mention of Greta Thunberg and Fridays for Future shows support.

Putting it all together, despite initial hesitation ("meh"), there's a clear expression of happiness that climate issues are getting more attention due to youth involvement. The positive emotions come through with words like "happy" and enthusiastic hashtags. So I think the main emotion here is joy.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion conveyed by the author. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Looking at the tweet: "It's always been a meh kind of issue. With more youth getting involved maybe it's finally getting attn. Depends who they asked, of course! But I was happy to see it, because climate usually never makes the list. #buzzbuzz üêù #GretaThunberg #Fridays4Future #TheYoungPeopleWillWin"

First, the author mentions that it's been a "meh" issue, which is neutral or somewhat negative. Then they express hope that with more youth involvement, it might get attention. They mention it depends on who was asked, but overall, they were happy to see it because climate usually doesn't make the list.

The key here is the word "happy." That's a clear indicator of joy. The hashtags also seem positive, like support for Greta Thunberg and Fridays for Future, with an optimistic ending about young people winning.

So despite some initial neutral or cautious language, the overall sentiment is positive because of the explicit mention of happiness.

Alright, let's try to figure out the emotion in this tweet about Greta Thunberg and Fridays for Future. The user wrote, "Its always been a meh kind of issue. With more youth getting involved maybe it's finally getting attn. Depends who they asked, of course! But I was happy to see it, because climate usually never makes the list. #buzzbuzz üêù #GretaThunberg #Fridays4Future #TheYoungPeopleWillWin"

First, breaking down the tweet: The user starts by saying it's always been a "meh" issue, which sounds indifferent or maybe a bit disappointed. But then they mention that with more youth involvement, it might finally get attention. They express hope here. They acknowledge that it depends on who was asked, showing some skepticism but not too negative. Then they say, "I was happy to see it," clearly indicating joy. They also note that climate issues usually don't make the list, implying that this time is different and positive.

Looking at the hashtags: #buzzbuzz with a bee emoji suggests excitement or buzz around the topic. The other hashtags are all related to Greta Thunberg's movement and youth involvement, which ties into the positive sentiment expressed.

Considering the emotion categories:
- Anger: Not present here; no signs of frustration.
- Disgust: No elements of dislike or disinterest beyond the initial "meh," but that's more about indifference.
- Fear: There's no sense of worry or anxiety.
- Joy: The user explicitly says they were happy, which fits this category. The excitement in hashtags also supports this.
- Sadness: Doesn't seem to be present; the overall tone is positive.
- Surprise: Not really, as the user seems informed and hopeful.

So, the emotion here is definitely joy because of the explicit statement of happiness and the enthusiastic tone.
