Alright, let's figure out how to classify this tweet. So, the user is asking about the emotion behind it, and they've given specific categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

Looking at the tweet itself: It starts by questioning who Greta Thunberg is, listing her achievements like being on the influential people list, encouraged by the Pope, a Nobel Peace Prize nominee, and compares her to Che Guevara. Then it takes a sharp turn, suggesting she's just a child abused by media.

The tone here seems critical and skeptical. The hashtags and questions imply doubt or disbelief about her status. Comparing her to Che Guevara could be either admiration or sarcasm. But the last part about being "abused by media" sounds more like an attack, questioning her authenticity or motives.

Considering the emotion categories: anger might fit if there's frustration, but the tweet isn't overtly angry. Disgust is about dislike or aversion. The way Greta is portrayed as manipulated or overhyped could evoke disgust. There's a sense of distrust and disdain towards how she's presented in media.

Fear, sadness, joy, surprise don't seem to fit here. It's not about fear of something happening, nor is it sad or joyful. Surprise isn't really the emotion either; more so it's disbelief or skepticism which can fall under disgust as a form of strong dislike.

**disgust**

Alright, I need to classify this tweet's emotion based on the given categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Let me read through the tweet carefully.

The tweet starts with a girl emoji and mentions Greta Thunberg in several ways. It questions her influence, mentioning she's one of the 100 most influential people, encouraged by the Pope, a Nobel Peace Prize nominee, and compares her to Che Guevara. Then it contrasts that with her being "just a child abused by media."

So, the author is posing these questions but ends with a statement questioning whether she's overhyped or mistreated by the media. The tone seems critical, suggesting doubt about her influence and accuses the media of abusing her.

Looking at the emotion categories:

- Anger: There's some criticism here, but it's more about skepticism.
- Disgust: The tweet expresses distrust towards Greta's influence and the media's role, which fits disgust as it includes dislike and disapproval.
- Fear: Not really present here.
- Joy/Serenity: Nope, the tone isn't positive.
- Sadness/Pensiveness: Maybe a bit, but not the main emotion.
- Surprise: Doesn't seem to fit.

So, the primary emotion is disgust because the author is showing dislike and distrust towards Greta Thunberg's influence and how she's portrayed by the media.

Alright, let's break down this query step by step. I'm trying to figure out the emotion behind the tweet provided about Greta Thunberg.

First, the tweet is asking a series of rhetorical questions about who Greta Thunberg is. It mentions she's one of the most influential people, encouraged by the Pope, a Nobel Peace Prize nominee, and even compares her to Che Guevara. Then it flips to question if she's just a child abused by media.

Looking at the language used, there's a lot of contrast here. The first part highlights her influence and recognition, which is positive. But then it sharply contrasts that with suggesting she might be exploited or misrepresented by the media. This shift seems to indicate some skepticism or doubt about her status.

The use of emojis like üõë could symbolize stopping or highlighting something important, but in this context, it might emphasize the contrast between praise and criticism. The mention of being "abused by media" implies negative feelings towards how she's portrayed, possibly indicating disgust or dislike.

I need to consider the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. There's no clear sign of anger or rage here; it's more aboutË¥®Áñë or distrust. Dislike would fall under disgust, which includes disinterest and dislike.

So, putting it all together, the author seems to express a mix of admiration but also skepticism towards Greta Thunberg's media portrayal. The emotion conveyed is likely disgust because they're showing disapproval or dislike for how she's being handled by the media.

The tweet expresses **disgust** as it questions and criticizes Greta Thunberg's influence and media treatment, suggesting skepticism and disapproval.
