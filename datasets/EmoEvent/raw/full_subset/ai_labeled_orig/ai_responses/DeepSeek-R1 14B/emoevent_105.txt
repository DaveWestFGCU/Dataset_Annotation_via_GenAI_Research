Record: "A monument to human creation/achievement has been lost. That it's been used as a house of worship is irrelevant. That some in our community are behaving as reactionary tribalists shouldn't guide our response. Condolences. #NotreDame #NotreDameCathedralFire #NotreDameCathedral https://t.co/ZyrlwFNXOR"

Alright, I need to classify the emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let's read it carefully.

The author starts by calling it a "monument to human creation/achievement" which has been lost. That sounds sad because they're talking about something valuable being destroyed. They mention that its use as a house of worship is irrelevant, which might be trying to detach the emotion from religious context but still expresses loss. 

Then they criticize some community members for behaving "as reactionary tribalists." This shows frustration or disappointment, leaning towards anger or disgust. However, the overall message focuses on the tragedy and expressing condolences, which are associated with sadness.

The use of words like "lost" and "condolences" definitely points to a feeling of loss and empathy, which aligns with sadness rather than anger or surprise. The tone is mournful, reflecting grief over the destruction.

Okay, I need to classify the emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let me read it carefully.

The author starts by calling it a "monument to human creation/achievement," which sounds positive, but then says it's been lost. That makes me think of loss and sadness. They mention that its use as a house of worship is irrelevant, maybe showing some detachment or focusing on the loss of cultural heritage.

Next, they talk about some community members behaving "reactionary tribalists" and not letting that guide the response. This part seems more like frustration with how people are reacting, possibly implying anger or disappointment. But the overall tone isn't aggressive; it's more reflective.

The tweet ends with condolences, which is a clear sign of sympathy and sadness. They also use relevant hashtags, showing they're aware of the event but not necessarily expressing anger or surprise.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The key emotions here are loss and condolence, pointing towards sadness. There's an element of frustration with reactions but it doesn't dominate the overall sentiment. So, the primary emotion is sadness.

Alright, let's see. I need to classify the emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

The tweet starts by calling the cathedral a monument to human creation and achievement, which sounds respectful but then says that its use as a house of worship is irrelevant. That might be neutral or critical, but not necessarily any specific emotion yet. 

Then it mentions some people in the community behaving like reactionary tribalists, which could imply frustration or criticism towards certain reactions, maybe leaning toward anger or disgust. However, the tone here isn't overtly angry; it's more of an observation.

The author expresses condolences, which is a clear indicator of sadness. Condolences are typically offered when someone is expressing sympathy or mourning a loss, so that points directly to sadness.

Looking at the overall message, the author seems concerned about the loss and possibly critical of certain reactions but ends with condolences, which emphasizes the emotional weight of the event. There's no indication of fear, surprise, joy, or disgust beyond mild criticism, so sadness is the most fitting emotion.
