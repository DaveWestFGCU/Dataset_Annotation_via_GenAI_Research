Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion the author of this tweet is conveying. The tweet says: "I'm scared...please world, do something to change #climatechange #GretaThunberg #ClimateBreakdown #ClimateAction #ClimateEmergency https://t.co/D4GGXKDoUx". 

First, I'll break down the content. The author starts with "I'm scared...", which immediately indicates fear. They're expressing a personal emotion here. Then they plead, "please world, do something to change", showing urgency and concern about climate change.

Looking at the hashtags used: #climatechange, #GretaThunberg, #ClimateBreakdown, #ClimateAction, #ClimateEmergency. These all relate to environmental issues, particularly climate change, which is a significant and often fear-inducing topic due to its implications for the future.

The mention of Greta Thunberg ties it back to the movement she started, "Fridays for Future", which focuses on youth-led strikes to demand action against climate change. The use of terms like "ClimateBreakdown" and "ClimateEmergency" further emphasizes the urgency and seriousness of the situation, both of which are fear-related.

I don't see any elements indicating anger, disgust, joy, or surprise in this tweet. The emotion expressed is clearly fear, as the author directly states they're scared and uses strong language to convey the pressing need for action.

Okay, I need to classify this tweet into one of the given emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The tweet is from someone who says, "I'm scared...please world, do something to change #climatechange #GretaThunberg #ClimateBreakdown #ClimateAction #ClimateEmergency." 

First, looking at the words used. The user explicitly states they're "scared," which immediately points towards fear. They express desperation with phrases like "please world, do something." This shows anxiety or apprehension about climate change.

The hashtags include #climatechange, which is a serious issue, and terms like #ClimateBreakdown and #ClimateEmergency, which can evoke urgency and fear. The mention of Greta Thunberg, who's known for highlighting the climate crisis, supports the idea that the tweet is about a worrying situation.

I should consider if any other emotions might fit. There's no indication of anger or annoyance, so probably not anger. Disgust isn't really present here. Sadness could be a possibility since climate change is a sad topic, but the user explicitly says they're scared, which is more directly fear.

So, the emotion conveyed here is clearly fear because of the direct statement and the context provided by the hashtags and tone.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet into one of the given emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let's look at the tweet closely.

The tweet says, "I'm scared...please world, do something to change #climatechange #GretaThunberg #ClimateBreakdown #ClimateAction #ClimateEmergency." The user starts with "I'm scared," which immediately indicates fear. They're expressing worry about climate change and are pleading for action.

Now, considering the options: anger would be if they were upset or annoyed. Disgust might come from disliking something, but that's not what's here. Fear is directly stated. Sadness could be another option since climate issues can cause grief, but the explicit use of "scared" leans more towards fear.

Surprise isn't really applicable because there's no element of unexpectedness. So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed is fear.
