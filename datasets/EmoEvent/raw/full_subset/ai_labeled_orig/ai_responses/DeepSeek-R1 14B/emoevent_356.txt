Alright, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion from the given list. Let me start by reading the tweet carefully. The user says, "Also, who the fuck came up with that battle strategy, I genuinely can't think of a worse display #GameOfThrones." 

First, the use of profanity like "fuck" indicates some strong emotion. They're clearly frustrated or annoyed. Words like "who the fuck" show irritation or anger towards whoever made the battle strategy. The phrase "I genuinely can't think of a worse display" emphasizes their disappointment, which adds to that frustration.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger includes annoyance and rage, so that seems fitting here. They're not expressing disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. It's more about being annoyed by something they saw as poorly executed in Game of Thrones.

I should consider if there's any possibility it could be another emotion. Disgust might involve dislike, but the primary feeling here is more frustration than pure dislike. Fear would relate to anxiety, which isn't present. Joy and surprise are clearly not applicable here. Sadness could be a contender because they're disappointed, but the intensity of anger seems stronger given the use of profanity.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed in this tweet is primarily anger due to the frustration expressed towards the battle strategy.

Okay, let's see. I need to classify this tweet into one of the given emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

The tweet says: "Also, who the fuck came up with that battle strategy, I genuinely can't think of a worse display #GameOfThrones". 

First, breaking down the words. The user uses "who the fuck", which is clearly an expression of anger or frustration. They're questioning someone's decision about a battle strategy, and they say it's the worst display ever.

So, the emotions here are frustration and possibly surprise, but more likely anger because they're explicitly using strong language. Thereâ€™s no indication of fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The main emotion is frustration at something being done poorly.

Therefore, the emotion conveyed is anger.
