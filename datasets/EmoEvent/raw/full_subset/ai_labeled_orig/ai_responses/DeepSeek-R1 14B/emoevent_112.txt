Alright, so I need to classify this tweet into one of the given emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The tweet is "Leo Leo! Best player. So it's done. #LaLiga". 

First, looking at the content, the user mentions Leo Messi, calling him the best player and then says "So it's done." followed by the hashtag #LaLiga. I know that La Liga is the top Spanish football league, so maybe this tweet is about a match or a season ending.

The exclamation "Leo Leo!" seems excited, showing enthusiasm. The use of "Best player" is a compliment, which indicates positive feelings. The phrase "So it's done." could be referring to the end of something significant, perhaps a game or a season where Messi performed exceptionally.

I'm considering each emotion category:

- Anger: Doesn't seem right because there's no indication of frustration or irritation.
- Disgust: Unlikely as the tweet is praising, not expressing dislike.
- Fear: There's no sense of worry or anxiety here.
- Joy: Fits well because the exclamation and praise suggest happiness or excitement.
- Sadness: No signs of sorrow or grief in the message.
- Surprise: Maybe if there was an unexpected outcome, but the tone seems more celebratory than surprised.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed is joy. The user is expressing excitement about Messi's performance, likely celebrating a victory or a great season.
