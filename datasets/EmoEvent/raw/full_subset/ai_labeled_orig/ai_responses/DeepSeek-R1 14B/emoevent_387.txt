Okay, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Let me start by reading the tweet carefully.

The tweet says, "This #WorldBookDay, give the gift of reading. Today, with every book you buy at [link], you'll be making one new ebook available to readers in our programs. Thank you for spreading the joy of reading far and wide! USER #WBD2019 [another link]"

Hmm, the user is promoting World Book Day by encouraging others to buy books, which in turn provides ebooks to their programs. The message is positive, talking about giving the gift of reading and spreading joy. Words like "joy" are explicitly used.

Looking at the emotion categories, joy seems to fit here because they're expressing happiness and enthusiasm about reading. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or disgust. It's all about celebrating books and sharing the love for reading. The tone is uplifting and encouraging.

I don't see elements of fear, surprise, sadness, or disgust. It's purely a positive message aimed at spreading joy through reading.

The tweet conveys **joy** as it emphasizes giving the gift of reading and spreading happiness.
