Okay, I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion it conveys. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

The tweet says: "USER USER hack and Obama flunkie thinks the #Venezuela people fighting for freedom against an illegitimate socialist dictator is a coup. ü§¶‚ôÇÔ∏è"

First, I notice words like "hack," which might imply someone is being manipulated or deceived. The mention of Obama flunkie could be derogatory, suggesting that person lacks credibility.

The main content talks about the Venezuela situation. The author refers to Maduro as an illegitimate socialist dictator and implies that supporting him is wrong. The use of "fighting for freedom" indicates a struggle against oppression, which aligns with the context given in the problem statement about the legitimacy crisis between Maduro and Guaido.

The reaction emoji ü§¶‚ôÇÔ∏è (face palm) suggests exasperation or disbelief at the other person's perspective. So the author is expressing frustration with someone else's viewpoint.

Putting it together, the tweet shows strong disapproval of how the situation is being perceived by others, which points to disgust. The author is disgusted by the characterization as a coup and the dismissal of the struggle for freedom.

**disgust**

Alright, I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion the author intended to convey. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Looking at the tweet: "USER USER hack and Obama flunkie thinks the #Venezuela people fighting for freedom against an illegitimate socialist dictator is a coup. ü§¶‚ôÇÔ∏è"

First, I notice words like "hack," "Obama flunkie," and calling Maduro a "socialist dictator." These terms are derogatory and show frustration or resentment towards someone's viewpoint.

The author refers to Juan Guaido's supporters as fighting for freedom against an illegitimate leader. Using terms like "illegitimate socialist dictator" indicates strong negative feelings about Maduro, suggesting anger or disgust.

The hand-waving emoji ü§¶‚ôÇÔ∏è is a sign of exasperation or dismissal, which often accompanies feelings of frustration or anger.

Putting it together, the tweet expresses strong disapproval and frustration towards someone's perspective on Venezuela. This points more to anger rather than disgust because the focus is on opposing an oppressive regime, not just dislike for a person or action.

The tweet uses strong language against Maduro and dismisses others' views with an exasperated emoji, indicating frustration and resentment.

**anger**

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a tweet and wants it classified into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says, "USER USER hack and Obama flunkie thinks the #Venezuela people fighting for freedom against an illegitimate socialist dictator is a coup. ü§¶‚ôÇÔ∏è"

Breaking this down, the author mentions Venezuela's situation, refers to someone as an "Obama flunkie," which seems like a disrespectful term implying incompetence or loyalty to a previous administration. The tweet criticizes this person's view on the Venezuelan crisis, calling it a coup when others see a fight for freedom.

The use of "hack" and the face-palm emoji ü§¶‚ôÇÔ∏è suggests frustration or disbelief. The author is clearly opposing the viewpoint expressed by the "Obama flunkie," indicating strong disagreement.

Looking at the emotion categories:

- Anger: Fits because the tweet expresses irritation, perhaps even outrage towards the criticized opinion.
- Disgust: Could be there too, but it's more about disapproval rather than anger.
- Fear: Not present here; no signs of anxiety or terror.
- Joy, Sadness, Surprise: None of these emotions are evident.

Between anger and disgust, I think anger is stronger here. The author isn't just disapproving but seems annoyed or frustrated with the flunkie's stance on Venezuela.

So, the emotion conveyed is likely **anger**.
</think>

The tweet conveys **anger** due to its critical tone and frustration towards the mentioned viewpoint. 

**Answer:** **anger**
