Alright, so I need to figure out what emotion is being conveyed in this tweet about Leo Messi. Let me break it down.

The tweet starts with "Leo oh Leo." That seems like a lot of enthusiasm, maybe even admiration. The words used are super positive—calling him "out of the world," "the god of the game," and mentioning 600 goals. Those stats add to the praise, showing how impressive he is.

Then there's the part about a free kick from "top tier." Free kicks usually require skill and precision, so that's another layer of praise. The hashtags also seem related to soccer, specifically Barcelona and the Champions League, which adds context about the significance of Messi's performance.

Looking at the emotion list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I don't see any negative emotions here. It's all about celebrating Messi's achievements. The use of words like "god," "top tier," and the excited repetition of his name suggest strong positive feelings.

Okay, I need to classify this tweet into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let's look at the tweet closely.

The tweet says, "Leo oh Leo. Totally out of the world. The god of the game. 600 goals for the man. And one free kick from top tier." There are also several hashtags mentioning Dios (God), BarçaLFC, FCBLIV, etc., related to football and the Champions League.

First, "Leo" is likely referring to Lionel Messi, a renowned footballer known for his exceptional skills and goal-scoring ability. The author is clearly expressing admiration with phrases like "totally out of the world," "god of the game," and mentioning 600 goals. These expressions show high praise and excitement.

The use of words like "out of the world" and "god of the game" indicates an elevated level of respect and awe. The mention of a free kick from "top tier" adds to the impressiveness, suggesting that even such specific skills are exceptional.

Considering the emotion categories:
- Anger: Doesn't fit here; there's no indication of frustration or irritation.
- Disgust: Also not applicable; the tone is positive.
- Fear: No signs of fear or anxiety.
- Sadness: The tweet isn't sad; it's celebratory.
- Surprise: While Messi's skills are impressive, the language doesn't express sudden surprise but rather admiration and praise.
- Joy: This seems to fit best. The author is expressing joy and excitement about Messi's achievements and skill level.

The hashtags also support this—topics like #Dios (God), which might be used to emphasize Messi's exceptional status, and Champions League-related tags show engagement and enthusiasm in the footballing world.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed here is joy.
