Alright, let's figure out the emotion behind this tweet. The user is asking to classify it into one of six categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says, "Don't be a fucking idiot! The world needs your support, udumass!" repeated twice with some hashtags related to climate change and strikes. 

The language used is strong—"fucking idiot" and "udumass" are derogatory terms, which shows frustration or irritation. Repeating the same phrases emphasizes the intensity of the emotion.

Looking at the categories: anger includes annoyance and rage. The use of profanity and the harsh words definitely point towards anger rather than other emotions like disgust or surprise. There's no indication of fear or sadness here; it's more about confrontation and urging action, which fits into anger.

The tweet uses strong language with derogatory terms and repetition to convey frustration and urgency, indicating **anger**.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion it conveys. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Looking at the tweet: "Don't be a fucking idiot! The world needs your support, udumass! Don't be a fucking idiot! The world needs your support, udumass!" There's a lot of strong language here—using words like "fucking idiot" and "udumass," which I think is slang for stupid or dumb. Repeating the same phrases adds to the intensity.

The hashtags mention Greta Thunberg, climate change topics, so it's related to environmental activism. The author is clearly frustrated, maybe towards people who aren't taking action on climate issues. They're calling out others harshly, which shows anger rather than other emotions like disgust or fear.

I don't think it's surprise because there's no indication of unexpected news. It's more about the frustration and irritation with inaction, so anger fits best.

Okay, I need to classify the emotion in this tweet. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet says: "Don't be a fucking idiot! The world needs your support, udumass! Don't be a fucking idiot! The world needs your support, udumass!"

First, the language is strong with expletives like "fucking idiot" and "udumass," which seems aggressive. The repetition of these phrases emphasizes frustration or anger.

The hashtags include #GretaThunberg and climate-related topics, so it's likely related to environmental activism, similar to Fridays for Future.

Considering the emotion categories: anger includes annoyance and rage. The use of strong language suggests anger rather than other emotions like fear or sadness. There's no clear expression of joy or surprise here; instead, the tone is confrontational.

So, the primary emotion conveyed is anger.
