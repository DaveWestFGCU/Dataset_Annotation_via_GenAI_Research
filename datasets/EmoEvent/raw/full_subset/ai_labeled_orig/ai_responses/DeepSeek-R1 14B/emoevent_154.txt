Alright, so I need to classify the emotion of this tweet regarding the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user wants me to choose from anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me break down the tweet step by step.

The tweet starts with "Tossed but not sunk...I like that💗💪🏻". The phrase "tossed but not sunk" suggests resilience and positivity. The emojis used are a heart and a flexing arm, which are positive symbols showing support and strength.

Next, the author says, "We can all rebuild, no matter how tossed or how much the tearing down hurt or cost us." This is encouraging and hopeful, focusing on rebuilding despite challenges. It's about moving forward after something bad happened.

Then, they mention "Strong buttresses can withstand a lot..." which again ties into resilience and strength. The hashtags used are #mymorningmusings, #TuesdayTruths, #NotreDameCathedralFire, and #NotreDame. These suggest they're reflecting on the situation and sharing uplifting thoughts related to the cathedral's fire.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger would involve frustration or rage, which isn't here. Disgust is about dislike, which doesn't fit. Fear involves anxiety, not present. Joy is about happiness or serenity, which seems close because the tweet is positive. Sadness is about grief, but while the event was sad, the tone is more hopeful. Surprise would be unexpected, which isn't the case here.

So, despite the sad event, the author's message is about resilience and rebuilding with hope, fitting into joy.

Alright, let's break this down. I need to figure out the emotion behind this tweet regarding the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire.

First, looking at the content: The user mentions being "tossed but not sunk," which sounds like resilience or positivity despite challenges. They express liking that sentiment, showing agreement or approval. Phrases like "we can all rebuild" and "strong buttresses can withstand a lot" emphasize hope and determination.

The hashtags also give context: #mymorningmusings, #TuesdayTruths indicate daily reflections; #NotreDameCathedralFire is the event in question. The link might be additional content, but from the text alone, it's clear they're talking about the fire.

Emotionally, the words used are uplifting and encouraging. They're not showing anger, disgust, fear, or surprise—they’re focused on rebuilding and strength. There’s a positive spin on the situation, suggesting resilience rather than sadness over the loss.

So, considering the options: anger is out since there's no frustration expressed. Disgust isn't present either; it's more about moving forward. Fear doesn’t fit because they're talking about overcoming challenges. Joy or serenity could be a contender, but the context is more about determination than pure happiness. Sadness might seem possible due to the event, but the tone is hopeful.

Surprise also doesn’t apply here as there’s no element of unexpectedness in their message. The emotion conveyed seems to be a mix of hope and resilience, which aligns most with joy because it's about positive outcomes and perseverance.

Therefore, the emotion is **joy**.

The tweet expresses positivity and resilience despite the tragedy. Words like "rebuild" and "strong buttresses" convey determination and hope, fitting under **joy**.

**joy**
