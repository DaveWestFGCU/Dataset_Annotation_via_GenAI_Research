Alright, let's tackle this classification task. The user has given me a tweet and wants me to determine the emotion conveyed by the author using one of six categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says, "Happy #WorldBookDayðŸ“š! We've got a great list of staff recommended #animation books to add to your shelves ðŸ‘‰https://t.co/VQtF5VrgAp Happy reading! ðŸ˜‰ https://t.co/z7H9Jdbqb5". The first thing I notice is the use of "Happy" at the beginning. That's an explicit expression of joy.

Next, looking at the content: they're promoting a list of animation books recommended by staff. They include emojis like a book and a pointing hand, which are positive and encouraging. The inclusion of a smiley face (ðŸ˜‰) also adds to the cheerful tone.

The links provided likely lead to more information or where to find these books, which is another positive gesture aimed at helping others. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or disgust. No words or expressions suggest fear, surprise, or sadness.

Considering all this, the overall sentiment is clearly positive and joyful. The author is celebrating World Book Day and sharing something beneficial, so their intended emotion is joy.
