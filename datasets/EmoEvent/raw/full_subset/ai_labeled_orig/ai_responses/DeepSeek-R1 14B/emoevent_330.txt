Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion this tweet is conveying from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The user's asking me to pick only one, the most relevant.

Looking at the tweet: "Good to see all these super rich donations for Notre Dame Cathedral. So why can’t the elite all club together to end World Famine? Or homelessness? Why can’t they do something new & revolutionary??? #NotreDameCathedralFire #elite #revolutionary #neworder #changes #HumanityFirst"

The author starts by mentioning that it's good to see donations from the rich, but then questions why these elites aren't addressing bigger issues like world famine and homelessness. They end with rhetorical questions, implying frustration or anger.

I'm thinking about the emotions: The first part is positive, but the second part is critical. The use of words like "why can’t," "something new & revolutionary???", and hashtags suggesting a call to action for change—this seems more like frustration rather than pure anger. But since the options are limited, maybe it's best categorized under 'anger' because they're challenging the elites' priorities and actions.

Wait, but is there any element of surprise? The tweet doesn't express astonishment or unexpectedness; instead, it's a critique. So probably not surprise. Sadness would be more about grieving, which isn't directly present here. Fear? No. Joy? Definitely not. Disgust could be possible if they're expressing dislike towards the elites' actions, but the emotion seems more directed at their lack of action on bigger issues.

Hmm, maybe it's a mix of anger and disgust. But since I have to choose one, and the main sentiment is frustration with the current situation, I think 'anger' is the most fitting.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion. Let me read the tweet carefully.

The user starts by saying it's good to see all these super rich donations for Notre Dame Cathedral. Then they question why the elite can't come together to end World Famine or homelessness. They ask why they don't do something new and revolutionary, using several hashtags related to the cathedral fire, elite, revolution, etc.

Hmm, the tone seems critical towards the wealthy donating to a building while ignoring bigger issues like famine and homelessness. The use of words like "why can’t" and "something new & revolutionary" shows frustration or disappointment. I don't see any signs of anger explicitly, but there's definitely a sense of dissatisfaction with the current situation.

The user is pointing out a contrast between donations to a cathedral and neglecting global issues, which might evoke feelings of sadness because it reflects a deeper problem that isn't being addressed. Alternatively, it could be seen as frustration or disappointment, which fall under anger in the given categories. But since they're expressing sorrow over missed opportunities for positive change, I think sadness is more fitting.

So, considering all this, the emotion conveyed here is likely sadness.

**sadness**

Alright, let's figure out the emotion in this tweet. The user is talking about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire and mentions donations from the wealthy. They're questioning why these elites don't use their resources to address bigger issues like world famine or homelessness instead. Words like "why can’t," "end World Famine," and "革命性(new &amp; revolutionary)" show frustration and disappointment. The tone is critical, pointing out a lack of meaningful action. So the emotion here is likely sadness because they're expressing grief over missed opportunities for positive change.

The tweet expresses **sadness** as it laments the lack of significant actions by the elite to address major global issues despite their ability to contribute, highlighting a sense of disappointment and sorrow.

**sadness**
