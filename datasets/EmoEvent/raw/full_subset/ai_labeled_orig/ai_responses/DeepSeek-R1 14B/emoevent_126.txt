Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion this tweet conveys. The user is talking about being against spoilers and how hearing tiny details makes their brain extrapolate everything. They mention the stress of trying to catch up before someone spoils something unintentionally. 

Hmm, they use words like "REALLY STRESSFUL" which suggests they're feeling overwhelmed or anxious. The context is about avoiding spoilers for Game of Thrones, so it's not anger or disgust. It's more about the pressure and worry of not wanting to be spoiled.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger involves irritation, but here it's more about stress. Disgust isn't really applicable because it's not about dislike for the content itself. Fear could fit if there's a sense of apprehension, but I think anxiety or stress is more accurate. Joy and surprise don't seem to fit at all.

So, fear might be too specific to actual danger, while sadness is more about grief. The key emotion here seems to be anxiety or stress, which falls under the broader category of fear as per the list given.

The tweet expresses feelings of stress and anxiety regarding spoilers for Game of Thrones. The author uses words like "REALLY STRESSFUL" and talks about the pressure to catch up before being spoiled, indicating a sense of apprehension or anxiety.

**fear**

Wait, no, actually, upon re-reading, the emotion is more about feeling stressed or anxious rather than fear in terms of danger. However, since 'anxiety' falls under the broader category of fear in the given list, it's appropriate.

But I think "sadness" might be a better fit because they're expressing frustration and overwhelm, which can relate to sadness. Alternatively, maybe it's a mix of stress (fear) and frustration (anger). However, looking back, since 'stress' is under fear, the correct classification would be:

**fear**

Wait no, I think "sadness" might not capture it fully either. The key emotion is stress or anxiety, which aligns with fear in this context.

**fear**

The tweet conveys a sense of stress and anxiety about avoiding spoilers, fitting under the category of fear due to feelings of apprehension and pressure.

Alright, let's break down this tweet. The user starts by expressing a dislike for spoilers, saying that even a tiny detail makes their brain extrapolate everything. So, initial thoughts might lean towards disgust or maybe frustration.

But then they mention the stress of trying to catch up before someone unknowingly spoils something. The use of "REALLY STRESSFUL" is key here. Stress and anxiety are tied to fear, so that's a strong indicator.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger involves annoyance or rage, but while there's frustration, it's more about stress than outright anger. Disgust is more about dislike, which is present but not the primary feeling. Fear includes anxiety and apprehension, which fits the stressed tone.

So, putting it all together, the main emotion conveyed is fear due to the stress and anxiety described.
