Alright, let's break down this query. The user wants me to classify a tweet based on the emotion it conveys, choosing from anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully: "USER spreading #ConspiracyTheories during his interview about the #NotreDameCathedralFire is absolutely disgusting! #FearMonger #GoAway"

The key words here are "disgusting" and the hashtags like #FearMonger. The author is clearly expressing strong negative feelings towards someone who's spreading conspiracy theories about such a tragic event.

Looking at the emotion categories, "disgust" fits because the word itself is used. Also, the frustration with the fearmongering aligns with disgust. There's no indication of anger specifically, though disgust can sometimes overlap with that. But in this case, the primary emotion seems to be disgust due to the explicit use of the term and the context of spreading harmful theories.

So, I'll classify it as disgust.

Alright, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion. The user is talking about someone spreading conspiracy theories regarding the Notre-Dame Cathedral Fire. They call it "absolutely disgusting" and mention "#FearMonger #GoAway". 

First, looking at the words used: "disgusting" clearly points towards disgust. That's one emotion category. But let me check others too.

They're also using hashtags like FearMonger, which might imply fear, but I think the primary emotion here is more about disapproval rather than fear itself. The main sentiment expressed is strong dislike because of spreading conspiracy theories. 

So, even though there's a mention of fear, the dominant emotion in the tweet seems to be disgust.
</think>

The tweet uses the word "disgusting" and expresses disapproval towards someone spreading conspiracy theories, which falls under disgust.

**disgust**

First, let's break down the words used. The word "disgusting" stands out because it directly relates to one of the emotion categories: disgust. Disgust can include disinterest, dislike, and loathing, so this fits right in.

Next, I'll consider the other emotions to make sure I'm not missing something. There's a mention of "#FearMonger," but that's more about inciting fear rather than expressing it. However, the primary emotion expressed is clearly disgust because of the word choice and context.

The user is upset about someone spreading conspiracy theories during a serious event like the Notre Dame fire. The use of "absolutely disgusting" conveys strong dislike or aversion, which aligns with the disgust category. There's no indication of anger beyond this; the main focus is on disapproval.

So, considering all aspects, the emotion here is disgust.
