Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to classify a tweet based on the emotion it conveys from a predefined list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. 

First, I'll look at the tweet itself: "No shoe !!. Too arrogant or too ignorant #GretaThunberg..." It mentions Greta Thunberg and uses hashtags related to climate change. The text seems critical, using words like "arrogant" and "ignorant." These adjectives typically convey a negative sentiment.

Now, I need to map this to the emotion categories provided. Anger is about annoyance or rage. Disgust involves dislike or disinterest. Fear is more about anxiety or terror, which doesn't seem applicable here. Joy and surprise are positive emotions, so they're unlikely. Sadness could be an option if it's about grief or pensiveness, but the language here feels more like a direct attack rather than sadness.

The tweet isn't expressing fear or joy; it's directly criticizing Greta Thunberg's stance. The use of "too arrogant" suggests frustration and anger. So, putting it all together, the emotion here is likely anger.

Alright, I need to classify the emotion in this tweet about Greta Thunberg. The tweet says, "No shoe !!. Too arrogant or too ignorant" with several hashtags related to climate change and local areas.

First, looking at the words used: "Too arrogant or too ignorant." These phrases suggest the author is critical of Greta Thunberg's perceived attitude. The use of exclamation marks emphasizes strong feelings.

The emotion categories are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Since the tweet expresses criticism and disapproval, it points towards anger because of the words "arrogant" and "ignorant." There's a sense of frustration or annoyance, which falls under anger.

I don't think it's disgust because there's no indication of dislike for something恶心的 (disgusting). Fear isn't present either. The tone is more confrontational than surprised or joyful.

The tweet expresses criticism and disapproval towards Greta Thunberg, using words like "arrogant" and "ignorant." These terms convey frustration and anger.

Okay, I need to classify the emotion of this tweet about Greta Thunberg. Let's read it carefully.

The tweet says: "No shoe !!. Too arrogant or too ignorant" with some hashtags related to climate change and locations.

First, let's look at the content. The author is talking about someone not wearing a shoe and describes them as either "too arrogant" or "too ignorant." This seems like a critique of Greta Thunberg, possibly referring to her public appearances where she sometimes doesn't wear shoes.

The emotions listed are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to choose the most relevant one from these categories.

The words "arrogant" and "ignorant" imply a negative judgment about Greta's attitude or behavior. The author is expressing disapproval, maybe frustration or annoyance towards her. However, "arrogant" can sometimes lean more into anger, but "ignorant" might suggest a lack of concern or dismissiveness.

But considering the emotion categories, I think this tweet is more about disgust rather than pure anger. Disgust here would stem from disapproval of what the author perceives as arrogance or ignorance regarding climate change issues. The hashtags also relate to environmental concerns, so it's likely the author feels Greta isn't addressing the issue properly.

So, the emotion conveyed is probably disgust because it's about feeling negative towards her stance or behavior related to climate change.

**disgust**
