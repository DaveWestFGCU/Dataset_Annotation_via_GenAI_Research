Alright, let's break down this tweet: "It’s ALL been about Arya hasn't it. How very satisfying #GameofThrones". The user is talking about the entire series focusing on Arya and finds it satisfying.

First, I need to determine the emotion conveyed here. The word "satisfying" suggests a positive feeling. The use of emphasis with "ALL" indicates that the author feels this conclusion was fulfilling or rewarding.

Looking at the options: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Joy fits because it's about positivity and satisfaction. There's no indication of other emotions like surprise or fear; it's more about contentment.

Okay, I need to classify this tweet's emotion. The user wrote, "It’s ALL been about Arya hasn't it. How very satisfying #GameofThrones." Let me break this down.

First, the mention of Arya suggests they're talking about a character from Game of Thrones. The phrase "ALL been about" implies that the series focused on her, which could show some emphasis or perhaps a realization.

The user then says, "How very satisfying," which is key here. "Satisfying" indicates a positive feeling. They might be happy with how Arya's story played out or that she was central to the series.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Joy includes serenity and ecstasy, so satisfaction fits under joy. The tweet doesn't show any negative emotions like anger or disgust. There’s no fear, sadness, or surprise expressed.

So, the emotion here is joy because they're expressing satisfaction and a positive sentiment about Arya's role in the series.

Alright, I need to figure out what emotion is behind this tweet about Game of Thrones: "It’s ALL been about Arya hasn’t it. How very satisfying #GameofThrones". 

First, the user mentions that the whole series has been about Arya and says it's "how very satisfying." The word "satisfying" suggests a positive feeling, so maybe joy or contentment. Since joy is one of the options, that seems likely.

I should also consider other emotions to make sure I'm not missing something. Is there any sign of anger? Not really; the tone is more reflective and appreciative. Disgust? No, they seem happy about Arya's role. Fear or surprise? Doesn't fit here. Sadness? They're talking about it being satisfying, which is positive.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed is joy.
