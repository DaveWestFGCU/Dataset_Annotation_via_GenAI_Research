Alright, I'm trying to figure out the emotion in this tweet. Let's start by reading it carefully.

The tweet says: "Happy 90th Birthday Joanna Macy! üíê Listen to the conversation that I had with her for the USER here: https://t.co/pdOHyUc7AT ‚Ä¶ #thegreatturning #ClimateStrike #GretaThunberg #postcapitalism #podcast #FridayMotivation #workthatreconnects https://t.co/saf58TaOoK"

So, first off, the tweet is celebrating Joanna Macy's 90th birthday. The user is using a flower emoji üíê, which is typically associated with happiness or celebrations. They're also directing people to listen to their conversation with her and sharing some relevant hashtags.

Looking at the list of emotions I can use: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to choose the most appropriate one here.

The tweet starts with a birthday message, which is clearly positive. The emojis and the language used ("Happy") all point towards joy or happiness. They're also promoting their conversation and podcast, but in a celebratory tone.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise. It's all upbeat and cheerful. So, the emotion here is definitely joy.

Alright, so I need to figure out the emotion behind this tweet. Let's see... The tweet says "Happy 90th Birthday Joanna Macy! üíê" with some links and hashtags like #ClimateStrike and #GretaThunberg.

First off, the tweet starts with a birthday message which is clearly positive. The use of a flower emoji üíê adds to that happy vibe. Then there's a link to a conversation the author had, probably something inspiring or motivating given the context.

The hashtags include climate strike and Greta Thunberg, who are associated with environmental activism and Fridays for Future. This suggests the tweet is about spreading awareness or motivation related to climate issues. The mention of "FridayMotivation" also leans into a positive, encouraging tone.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Since the tweet is celebrating someone's birthday and promoting a cause with positive hashtags, it's likely conveying joy. There's no indication of any negative emotions here‚Äîno complaints or expressions of worry. The overall message seems uplifting and aimed at inspiring action in a positive way.

So, putting it all together, the emotion here should be joy.

Alright, so I need to classify the emotion in this tweet. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, let's read the tweet carefully. It says "Happy 90th Birthday Joanna Macy! üíê..." So right away, there's a birthday message with a flower emoji, which usually conveys happiness or celebration.

The rest of the tweet includes links and hashtags like #ClimateStrike and mentions Greta Thunberg. But the main sentiment here is clearly positive because it starts with "Happy 90th Birthday." The emojis used are also celebratory‚Äîspecifically the üíê, which is a flower emoji often associated with celebrations.

Looking at the options: anger is about irritation or rage, which doesn't fit here. Disgust would be dislike or aversion, not present. Fear is anxiety or terror, which isn't the case. Sadness is grief or pensiveness, also not applicable. Surprise involves being amazed, but here it's more of a celebration rather than surprise.

Joy encompasses happiness and serenity, which perfectly matches the birthday wishes and celebratory tone. So the emotion conveyed here is joy.
