Alright, I need to classify this tweet's emotion based on the given categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

Looking at the content, the author mentions a conspiracy about Muslims starting the fire and accuses both smart people and the Looney Left of making unfounded claims. They also talk about the situation being deemed an accident without investigation to prevent The Crusades from beginning. This suggests frustration with how the event is being handled or perceived.

The use of words like "smart people," "Looney Left," and sarcasm indicates that the author feels annoyed or upset with the responses from different groups. They're expressing irritation towards the way the fire's cause is being speculated without evidence, which points to anger.

Okay, I'm looking at this query where the user wants me to classify a tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. 

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It seems like the author is discussing how different groups are blamed for the fire. They mention Muslims being accused because of past incidents, then talk about the "Looney Left" labeling others as "Alt-Right monsters." The tweet also suggests that it's deemed an accident without investigation to prevent further conflict.

I need to figure out the emotion here. Anger is often about frustration or blame. The tweet expresses frustration with how the situation is being handled, pointing out biases and political motivations. They're clearly upset with how the media or public figures are assigning blame without evidence.

Disgust could be a contender because of the distaste for conspiracy theories, but the primary emotion seems more directed at the handling of blame rather than the event itself. Fear isn't present as there's no indication of personal danger or anxiety. Joy and surprise aren't applicable here. Sadness might relate to mourning the loss, but the focus is on the reaction to the fire rather than grief.

So, the main emotion is anger due to frustration with how the incident is being politicized and blamed without proper investigation.

Okay, I need to classify this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire into one of the six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let's break it down.

The tweet starts with a factual statement about what's known so far regarding the fire. Then it lists three points:

1. It mentions that some smart people are blaming Muslims for the fire because they've destroyed churches before.
2. The Looney Left is calling them all Alt-Right monsters, which seems to be a derogatory term.
3. They claim the incident was deemed an accident without investigation to prevent starting "The Crusades," implying some hidden agenda.

Looking at each point, the tone seems critical and negative towards both groups being blamed (Muslims and Alt-Right). The use of terms like "smart people" in a sarcastic way suggests frustration or anger. Also, accusing both sides without evidence might be intended to provoke or express strong dislike.

The overall message doesn't show fear, joy, or surprise. Sadness isn't the main emotion either; instead, it's more about attacking others rather than expressing grief over the event. The primary emotion conveyed is a mix of anger and disgust, focusing on frustration towards those blamed without proper investigation.
