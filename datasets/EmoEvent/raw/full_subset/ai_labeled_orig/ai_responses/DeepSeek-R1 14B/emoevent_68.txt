Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion is conveyed in this tweet about World Book Day. Let me look at the text carefully.

The tweet starts with "Books to the ceiling, Books to the sky..." It sounds like someone is excited or talking about a lot of books. Then it says, "My pile of books is a mile high." That's夸张，说明有很多书。接着是"How I love them! How I need them!" 这里用了love和need，表达了对书籍的喜爱和渴望。

然后作者说"I’ll have a long beard by the time I read them.” 这句话有点幽默，可能是在开玩笑说自己需要很长时间才能读完这些书，但同时也显示了他对阅读的热情。最后的标签是#WorldBookDay和#WorldBookandCopyrightDay，这些都是积极的话题。

从情感分类来看，选项有anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise。这里用了love, need, excited的语气，明显表达了joy的情绪。没有表现出愤怒、厌恶、恐惧或悲伤，也没有惊讶的感觉，主要是快乐和满足。

所以，这个推特的情感应该是joy。

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the emotion conveyed in this tweet about World Book Day. The user has given me a specific list of emotions to choose from: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. 

Looking at the tweet, it's a quote by Arnold Lobel talking about his love for books. He mentions a pile of books that's as high as a mile, and how he needs them so much that he'll have a long beard before he finishes reading them all. The hashtags are #WorldBookDay, #WorldBookDay2019, and #worldBookandCopyrightDay, which clearly relate to celebrating books.

I need to analyze the emotion here. The words "How I love them! How I need them!" express strong positive feelings towards books. The excitement is evident in phrases like "Books to the ceiling, Books to the sky," which suggests a sense of awe or enthusiasm. The person seems joyful because they're expressing their deep affection for reading and their collection of books.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise in this context. It's all about celebrating and cherishing books, which aligns with joy. So the emotion here is definitely joy.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a tweet related to World Book Day and wants it classified into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says, "Books to the ceiling, Books to the sky, My pile of books is a mile high. How I love them! How I need them! I’ll have a long beard by the time I read them.” – Arnold Lobel #WorldBookDay #WorldBookDay2019 #worldBookandCopyrightDay."

The language here is clearly expressing affection towards books. Words like "love" and "need" show strong positive feelings. The imagery of a towering pile of books adds to the enthusiasm.

Looking at the emotion categories, joy fits best because the author is expressing happiness and love for books. There's no indication of any negative emotions or surprise; it's purely celebratory.

I should make sure I'm not considering other options like surprise. While the tweet is about a large number of books, the emphasis isn't on being amazed by that fact but rather on the enjoyment derived from them.

So, after analyzing the content and sentiment, joy is definitely the most appropriate classification here.
