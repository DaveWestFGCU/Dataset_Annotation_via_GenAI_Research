Okay, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Let me read the tweet carefully.

The tweet says: "BREAKING: multi-nationals worth billions pitch in to save Notre Dame — Presumably so the multi-billionaire Catholic Church can save its funds to pay off victims of sex abuse. (Psst! Am I being too real again?) #NotreDameCathedralFire"

Alright, breaking it down. The user is talking about multinational companies donating to save Notre-Dame Cathedral after a fire. Then they question if the church is saving money instead of using it to pay sex abuse victims.

The tone here seems critical and upset. Words like "pitch in," "presumably," and the sarcastic aside "(Psst! Am I being too real again?)" indicate frustration or anger. The user is suggesting that while companies are donating, the church has other financial priorities that are more about self-preservation than addressing their own scandals.

So, looking at the emotion categories: anger includes annoyance and rage. This tweet feels more like frustration and criticism rather than disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. It's directed at the church's actions, showing irritation.

Therefore, the most relevant emotion is anger.

The author expresses frustration and irritation towards the Catholic Church's priorities, which falls under **anger**.

**emotion:** **anger**

Okay, let me try to figure out what emotion is behind this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user wants me to classify it into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says, "BREAKING: multi-nationals worth billions pitch in to save Notre Dame — Presumably so the multi-billionaire Catholic Church can save its funds to pay off victims of sex abuse. (Psst! Am I being too real again?) #NotreDameCathedralFire"

The tweet is reacting to the news that multinational companies are contributing money to help rebuild Notre-Dame after the fire. The author then makes a sarcastic comment suggesting that the Catholic Church might be saving its funds for other purposes, like paying off sex abuse victims.

I can sense some sarcasm and irony here. The use of "Presumably" indicates doubt or suspicion about the Church's intentions. Also, the phrase "(Psst! Am I being too real again?)" adds a tone of cheekiness but also implies that the author is exposing something they think others might find too harsh or truthful.

Looking at the emotion categories:

- Anger: This could be possible if the tweet expresses frustration or irritation. The author seems critical of the Church's priorities, which could stem from anger.
- Disgust: This involves feelings of dislike or revulsion. The sarcastic tone and implication about the Church's actions might show disgust.
- Fear: Doesn't seem to fit here; there's no indication of fear in the tweet.
- Joy/Serenity: Clearly not applicable as the tweet is negative.
- Sadness/Grief: There's a critique, but it doesn't convey sadness directly. It's more about criticism than mourning.
- Surprise: The tweet isn't expressing surprise but rather a pointed critique.

Between anger and disgust, I think disgust fits better because the author is expressing a strong dislike or aversion towards the Church's perceived actions. The sarcasm and irony are used to highlight what they see as a moral failing on the part of the institution, which aligns with disgust rather than just anger.

So, after considering all this, I believe the emotion here is disgust.

**disgust**

Okay, I need to figure out what emotion is conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let me start by reading the tweet carefully.

The tweet says: "BREAKING: multi-nationals worth billions pitch in to save Notre Dame — Presumably so the multi-billionaire Catholic Church can save its funds to pay off victims of sex abuse. (Psst! Am I being too real again?) #NotreDameCathedralFire"

Alright, breaking it down. The author is talking about multinational companies contributing money to save Notre-Dame. Then they suggest that the Catholic Church, which is wealthy, might be using these donations instead of their own funds to pay off victims of sex abuse. They also add a playful aside with "Am I being too real again?" but the main message seems critical.

The emotion categories are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. So which one fits?

Anger often involves frustration or irritation. The author is pointing out what they see as a misuse of funds by the Church, which could make them angry. They're frustrated that the money is going to save the cathedral instead of addressing the sex abuse allegations.

Disgust involves dislike or revulsion. The tweet expresses a negative view towards the Church's priorities, so there might be an element of disgust too.

Sadness would involve grief or sorrow, but here the tone isn't sad; it's more critical.

Fear? Not really, unless they're worried about the Church's actions, but I don't think that's the main emotion.

Joy and surprise are clearly not applicable here.

So between anger and disgust. The author is pointing out a hypocrisy, which can be seen as both angry and disgusted. But in terms of primary emotion, I think it leans more towards anger because they're expressing frustration about the situation.

**anger**
