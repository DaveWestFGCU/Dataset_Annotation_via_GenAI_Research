Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has given me a tweet about Game of Thrones and wants it classified into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, the tweet says, "Again, gravely disappointed we didn’t get the 'Now I am ALL Bran!’ line." The key words here are "disappointed" and "gravely." Disappointment usually falls under sadness because it's about unmet expectations or letdown. 

I should consider if any other emotions might fit. There's no obvious anger, as in frustration or rage. Disgust is more about dislike or厌恶, which doesn't seem to apply here. Fear isn't present; the tweet isn't expressing anxiety or terror. Joy and surprise are also not indicated—no positive feelings or unexpected news.

So, "disappointed" clearly points towards sadness. The user is expressing a sense of loss or unhappiness because something they wanted didn't happen. Therefore, the emotion conveyed here is sadness.

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion is in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user wrote, "Again, gravely disappointed we didn’t get the 'Now I am ALL Bran!' line." Hmm, they mention being "gravely disappointed," which makes me think they're really upset or unhappy about something not happening.

Let's break it down. They use "disappointed" which is a clear indicator of sadness. But I also see "gravely" which intensifies the feeling, so maybe it's more than just mild disappointment. The tweet is directed at others who are probably feeling the same way, sharing their frustration.

The emotion categories to choose from are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise. So, considering the words used, "disappointed" falls under sadness. They're expressing a sense of letdown or sorrow because a particular line wasn't included in the series finale.

I don't think it's anger because they're not expressing rage or annoyance directly—they're more focused on their own disappointment. It's not disgust or fear either; there's no indication of dislike for something or feeling anxious. Joy and surprise are also out of the question since the sentiment is clearly negative.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed here is sadness because of the expressed disappointment.

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion is conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says: "Again, gravely disappointed we didn’t get the ‘Now I am ALL Bran!’ line." First, let's break down the words used here.

The user starts with "gravely disappointed," which immediately tells me they're expressing dissatisfaction. "Gravely" suggests that their disappointment is serious or significant. They mention not getting a specific line from Bran, which probably means it was something they were really looking forward to or felt was important.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to pick one. "Disappointed" aligns with sadness because disappointment is often associated with feeling let down or unhappy. There's no indication of anger here; it's more about the emotional letdown rather than frustration or rage.

They could have used words that hint at other emotions, but "disappointed" clearly points towards sadness. Also, the use of "gravely" emphasizes the depth of their feelings, reinforcing that it's a significant emotion related to sadness.
