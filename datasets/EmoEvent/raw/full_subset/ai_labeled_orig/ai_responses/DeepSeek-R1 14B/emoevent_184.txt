Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion behind it. First, I notice the hashtags #cdnpoli and #MikeHudema, which might relate to Canadian politics or specific political figures. Then there's a mention of Greta Thunberg, who is known for her climate activism.

The author starts by saying, "We stand with you, you WONDERFUL Water Protectors!" The use of "WONDERFUL" in all caps suggests enthusiasm and support, which leans towards joy or maybe even surprise. But looking further, the tone shifts. They ask, "WHY is %$#@& alton - full of gaseous gas - gas going unpunished?" The exclamation marks and the use of "%$#@&" indicate frustration and anger.

They then address Justin with an exclamation: "YOU FIX THIS!" This direct command shows urgency and strong emotions. The overall message combines support for a cause with a frustrated call to action, but the intensity of the language points more towards anger rather than joy or surprise.

So, despite the positive words about Water Protectors, the dominant emotion is clearly frustration and anger directed at inaction regarding environmental issues.

Alright, let's tackle this query. The user provided a tweet and wants it classified into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It starts with hashtags related to Canadian politics and mentions Greta Thunberg. Then it says, "We stand with you, you WONDERFUL Water Protectors!" That's clearly a compliment, so that might lean towards joy or maybe even surprise because they're acknowledging their support.

Next part: "#cdnpoli #MikeHudema #GretaThunberg We stand with you, you WONDERFUL Water Protectors! ..WHY is %$#@& alton - full of gaseous gas - gas going unpunished? Justin...YOU FIX THIS!" The exclamation and the use of "%$#@&" show strong frustration. Words like "unpunished" suggest anger towards something not being addressed.

The user mentions Greta Thunberg, who's known for her climate strikes, so the context is environmental activism. The tweet seems to be protesting against something related to gas or pollution. The strong language and the plea to "YOU FIX THIS!" indicate frustration and anger rather than other emotions like disgust or fear.

I don't see any elements of joy, surprise, fear, or sadness here. The main emotion is definitely anger because of the harsh words and the demand for action.

Okay, I need to classify the emotion in this tweet. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet starts with hashtags related to Canadian politics and Greta Thunberg. Then it says, "We stand with you, you WONDERFUL Water Protectors!" That's clearly positive, using words like "WONDERFUL" which shows joy or support.

Next part: "#cdnpoli #MikeHudema #GretaThunberg We stand with you, you WONDERFUL Water Protectors! ..WHY is %$#@& full of gaseous gas - gas going unpunished? Justin...YOU FIX THIS!"

Here, the author uses strong language like "%$#@", which indicates frustration or anger. They're questioning why something harmful (gas) isn't being addressed and are urging someone to take action.

So, the first part expresses joy/support towards water protectors, but the latter part shows anger towards a situation they see as wrong and neglected. Since the main focus is on the problematic issue and the strong demand for change, the dominant emotion seems to be anger.
