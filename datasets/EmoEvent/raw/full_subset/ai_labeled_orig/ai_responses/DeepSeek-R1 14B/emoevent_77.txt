Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion behind this tweet about Notre-Dame Cathedral. The user is talking about Flight 49 landing from Paris and mentions being grateful for passengers sharing their stories regarding the fire at the cathedral.

First, let's break down the content. The tweet starts with information about a flight arriving from Paris, which connects it directly to the location of the Notre-Dame Fire incident. The mention of gratitude is key here because "I'm grateful" explicitly shows positive feelings.

Gratitude often falls under the category of joy or happiness, but sometimes it can also be associated with surprise if it's an unexpected positive event. However, in this case, the user isn't expressing surprise about anything specific; instead, they're expressing thanks for something that happened during their flight related to the fire incident.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Gratitude is a form of positive emotion, so it aligns with joy. The other emotions don't fit here because there's no indication of negative feelings or unexpectedness beyond the event itself, which is being discussed in a thankful manner.

So, the primary emotion conveyed is gratitude, which falls under the 'joy' category.

Okay, so I need to classify the emotion in this tweet related to the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the tweet: ". USER Flight 49 landed at USER from Paris around 2:30 p.m. today. I'm grateful to these passengers for sharing their stories with me: #NotreDameCathedralFire USER https://t.co/aLBco5PCLV". 

The user mentions being "grateful" and talks about passengers sharing their stories, which sounds positive. Gratitude usually falls under joy or maybe surprise because it's a positive reaction. However, the context is about the Notre Dame fire, which was a tragic event.

So, the author might be expressing gratitude in response to a sad situation. But the primary emotion conveyed here seems to be gratitude itself, which aligns with joy. Alternatively, since they're sharing stories after a disaster, it could show empathy and solidarity, but that's still within the realm of sadness or surprise.

Wait, does "grateful" fit into any other category? Gratitude is definitely a positive emotion, so joy makes sense because it's expressing thanks and appreciation. The mention of passengers sharing their stories might evoke feelings of connection and hope, which are joyful.

I'm leaning towards **joy** because the user is showing appreciation and positivity amidst a tragic event.

The tweet expresses gratitude and positivity, fitting within the category of joy.

Alright, so the user wants me to classify a tweet based on the emotion it conveys. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me read the tweet carefully.

The tweet says: ". USER Flight 49 landed at USER from Paris around 2:30 p.m. today. I'm grateful to these passengers for sharing their stories with me: #NotreDameCathedralFire USER https://t.co/aLBco5PCLV"

Hmm, the user mentions gratitude towards passengers who shared their stories related to the Notre-Dame Cathedral Fire. Gratitude is a positive emotion but it's not one of the options provided here. The closest might be joy because expressing gratitude often comes with positive feelings.

Wait, but the context is about a fire at a cathedral, which is a tragic event. So maybe there's a mix of emotions here. However, the tweet specifically mentions being grateful, so I should focus on that part.

The author is thankful and appreciative, which aligns more with joy or possibly surprise if it's an unexpected positive experience amidst tragedy. But since gratitude is part of joy, I think sadness isn't the primary emotion here despite the event's nature.

So, the emotion conveyed is likely joy because of the expression of gratitude.

**joy**
