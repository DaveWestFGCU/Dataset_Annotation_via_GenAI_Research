Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion behind this tweet regarding the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let's start by reading the tweet carefully.

The user writes: "Amazing there are homeless all over the world that get nothing yet an old building burns down 600 million raised in a day ðŸ¤” #povity #Homeless #sleepingruff #NotreDameCathedralFire #Notre_dame_de_Paris"

First, I notice the word "Amazing" at the beginning. That's a positive emotion, but let me not jump to conclusions yet because sometimes words can be sarcastic or have a hidden meaning.

The tweet is pointing out that while there are homeless people everywhere who get nothing, an old building (Notre Dame) burns down and raises 600 million in a day. The hashtags include #povity, which I think might be a typo for "poverty," and other related tags about homelessness.

So the author is clearly contrasting the attention and funds raised for Notre Dame with the neglect towards homeless people. They're expressing frustration that societal resources are prioritized towards an old building over human needs. 

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet isn't joyful or serene, so joy is out. It's not about fear or anxiety, so fear is also out. Sadness could be a possibility because of the contrast between need and resources, but the author seems more annoyed or frustrated.

The use of "Amazing" here might be sarcastic, implying that it's shocking or unbelievable in a negative way. The thought process expressed ("ðŸ¤”") adds to the contemplative and perhaps disapproving tone. So this is likely expressing anger or disgust.

Between anger and disgust: Anger usually involves frustration directed at something unfair or wrong. Disgust could be about disapproval of the situation or attitude towards how resources are allocated.

The tweet seems to express more frustration with the disparity, which aligns with anger. However, it's also a critique of society's priorities, which might lean towards disgust as well. But since the primary emotion is likely frustration and anger at the unfairness, I think "anger" is the most appropriate category.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet is about the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire and mentions homeless people getting nothing while an old building burns down, with 600 million raised in a day.

First, let me break down the content of the tweet. The author starts by saying "Amazing" which might seem positive at first glance, but the context changes that. They contrast the situation where homeless individuals worldwide get nothing (implying they're ignored or not helped) with an old building burning and raising 600 million in a day.

The use of "Amazing" here seems sarcastic or ironic because it's juxtaposed with a critical observation about inequality. The hashtags like #povity, #Homeless, #sleepingruff also point towards themes of poverty and homelessness, suggesting the author is highlighting a social issue they find concerning.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger would involve frustration or rage, disgust involves disliking something, fear is about anxiety, joy is positive feelings, sadness is grief, surprise is astonishment. The tweet isn't expressing happiness (joy) or fear. It's pointing out a disparity, which might lean towards disgust because the author seems to dislike the situation where resources are poured into a building while people are neglected.

Alternatively, it could be anger if they're frustrated about the lack of support for the homeless versus the attention given to the cathedral. But disgust is more about disliking or finding something repulsive, which fits here as the author is highlighting what they see as a wrong priority.

So, considering all this, I think the emotion conveyed is disgust because the author is expressing disapproval and distaste towards the situation where a building gets so much attention while people in need are ignored.

Okay, I need to classify this tweet's emotion. The user is talking about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire and mentions that while homeless people get nothing, an old building burns down and yet 600 million was raised in a day. They end with some hashtags related to poverty and homelessness.

Looking at the list of emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet seems to express frustration or dissatisfaction, pointing out a disparity between aid for the homeless and funds for a building. This might indicate anger because they're upset about the situation. Alternatively, it could be disgust towards the prioritization of saving the cathedral over helping the homeless.

I think the emotion here is more likely **anger**, as they're highlighting a perceived unfairness or injustice.
