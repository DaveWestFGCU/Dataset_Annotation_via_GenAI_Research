Okay, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion. The tweet is: "On #WorldBookDay, be inspired by these amazing books by and about refugees! Our reading list with USER ðŸ“š https://t.co/80DOcykOdf"

First, let me read it carefully. It's promoting a reading list related to refugees on World Book Day. The author is encouraging people to be inspired by these books.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

The words used are "inspired," "amazing books," and emojis like ðŸ“š which usually symbolize reading or books in a positive way. The overall tone seems uplifting and encouraging.

So, the emotions here don't point to anger, disgust, fear, or surprise. It's not sad because it's about inspiring people with good reads. Therefore, the emotion is likely joy because the author wants to spread positivity and inspiration.

Okay, so I need to classify the emotion of this tweet about World Book Day. The tweet says: "On #WorldBookDay, be inspired by these amazing books by and about refugees! Our reading list with USER ðŸ“š  https://t.co/80DOcykOdf". 

First, let me break down the content. The author is talking about World Book Day, which I know is a celebration of books and reading. They're encouraging others to be inspired by amazing books related to refugees. Using words like "inspired" and "amazing" suggests positivity. The mention of refugees might be a serious topic, but the overall tone here seems uplifting because they're highlighting these books in a positive light.

Looking at the hashtags and emojis, there's a book emoji ðŸ“š which is cheerful and related to reading. The link provided probably leads to more information or recommendations, adding to the enthusiasm. 

The emotions I can consider are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Anger doesn't seem right because the message isn't confrontational. Disgust? No, the topic is about refugees in a positive way. Fear and anxiety aren't present here. Sadness would be if they were talking about something negative or tragic without uplift.

Joy fits well because the author is celebrating books and inspiring others with a reading list. They're promoting positivity and knowledge, which are joyful themes. Surprise isn't applicable unless there's an unexpected twist, but this seems straightforward in its encouragement.

So I think the emotion here is joy.
