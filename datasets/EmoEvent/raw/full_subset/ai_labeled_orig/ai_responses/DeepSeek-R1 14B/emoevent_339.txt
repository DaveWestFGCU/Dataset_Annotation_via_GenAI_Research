Alright, I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion the author intended. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Looking at the tweet, the user is expressing frustration about the government's response to different events. They mention #NotreDameCathedralFire and compare it to issues like Flint, Puerto Rico, and three black churches. They're pointing out that while Notre Dame is getting attention, other issues are being ignored.

The tone seems strong and critical. Words like "folks don't vote Trump out" show anger. Also, the hashtags #WhiteSupremacist and #KKK imply disgust with the administration. The overall message is a call to action due to disappointment and frustration.

So, the primary emotion here is anger because of the direct criticism towards not voting Trump out, but there's also an element of disgust towards policies and actions they find offensive.

Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion behind this tweet. The user is talking about the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire and making a political statement. They mention that if people don't vote Trump out, it's their fault because he supports white supremacists. Then they compare the help given to Notre-Dame with the lack of support for Flint, Puerto Rico, and African churches, ending with a call to remove the KKK from the White House.

First, I notice the tweet is expressing strong dissatisfaction with how the government prioritizes aid. The use of hashtags like #WhiteSupremacist and #KKK indicates anger towards policies and actions perceived as discriminatory. They're linking Trump's administration to these negative groups, which shows a clear frustration or anger.

The user also points out that while help is being given to Notre-Dame, other issues like Flint's water crisis and Puerto Rico's recovery after the hurricane aren't getting enough attention. This comparison suggests they feel outraged because they believe resources are being misdirected based on biased priorities.

Furthermore, the tweet ends with a demand to remove the KKK from the White House, which is a strong statement of anger against what they see as systemic racism and injustice in the government. The overall tone is one of frustration and indignation towards the policies and actions (or lack thereof) of those in power.

So considering the emotion categories: anger includes annoyance and rage. The tweet uses strong language and makes direct accusations, which points more towards anger rather than any other emotions like fear or sadness. There's no indication of joy, surprise, or disgust in this context.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user has given a query where they want to classify a tweet into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The tweet in question is:

"If you folks don't vote #Trump out of office- It's your own fault. We live in a country that is run by a #WhiteSupremacist - The WH is offering assistance to #NotreDameCathedralFire and NOT #Flint #PuertoRico #3BlacksChurches- Let's remove the #KKK out of the White House https://t.co/FxS33KXxH6"

First, I need to break down the tweet. The author is clearly addressing Trump supporters, urging them to vote him out. They mention that the country is run by a white supremacist and list several issues: assistance given to Notre-Dame Cathedral after its fire but not to Flint, Puerto Rico, or three black churches. They end with a call to remove the KKK from the White House.

So, analyzing the emotion here. The language used is strong and accusatory. Words like "folks don't vote Trump out...your own fault," "run by a white supremacist," and "remove the KKK" show frustration and anger. They're expressing strong disapproval and are pushing for change because they're upset with the current administration's priorities.

I don't think it's disgust because disgust usually involves something repulsive, but maybe not in this context. Fear isn't present; there's no indication of worry or anxiety about future events. Joy is out of the question since the tone is negative. Sadness might be a possibility if they're grieving, but the tweet is more about anger towards policies and actions.

Surprise doesn't fit either because the content seems to be highlighting known issues rather than unexpected events. The main emotion here is clearly anger due to the strong language and the call to action against what the author perceives as injustices.
