Okay, I need to figure out which emotion this tweet conveys from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me read the tweet carefully.

The user mentions that "much was spared," but describes images of Notre-Dame on fire as "heart-breaking." They also note that watching the French mourn in song is "so sad and beautiful," likening it to a hopeful prayer to save their home. The hashtags used are #Notre_dame_de_Paris, #NotreDameCathedralFire, and #TuesdayThoughts.

The emotions expressed here are clearly about loss and sorrow. Words like "heart-breaking" and "sad" directly indicate sadness. Even though the tweet also mentions something beautiful and hopeful in the midst of mourning, the primary emotion seems to be sadness due to the destruction and the collective grief.

Alright, I need to figure out what emotion the author of this tweet is conveying regarding the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let's break down the tweet step by step.

The tweet starts with "They say much was spared," which indicates that the speaker knows that many parts were saved from the fire, but then shifts focus to the images of the cathedral in flames being heart-breaking. The use of "heart-breaking" clearly points towards sadness or grief.

Next, the author mentions watching the French mourn in song, describing it as "sad and beautiful like a hopeful prayer to save their #home." Here, the words "sad," "mourning," and "pray to save their home" reinforce feelings of sorrow and loss. The juxtaposition of "beautiful" with "sad" suggests that while there's an element of hope or resilience in the singing, the primary emotion is still sadness.

The hashtags used are #Notre_dame_de_Paris, #NotreDameCathedralFire, and #TuesdayThoughts. These reinforce the context of a tragic event, which again aligns with sadness rather than other emotions like anger or surprise.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger isn't present; there's no indication of frustration or rage. Disgust is also absent since the tweet doesn't express dislike or aversion. Fear or anxiety about future events isn't the focus here. Joy or serenity aren't evident eitherâ€”despite mentioning beauty, it's paired with sadness. Surprise would involve an unexpected event being highlighted, but the fire was a significant and widely reported event, so surprise isn't the main emotion.

Therefore, the dominant emotion in this tweet is sadness.

Alright, let's try to figure out what emotion the author of this tweet is conveying. The tweet talks about the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire, which is a significant and tragic event. The user mentions that much was spared but describes the images as "heart-breaking," which immediately makes me think of sadness.

They also say it's "so sad and beautiful" while comparing it to a hopeful prayer to save their home. Words like "heart-breaking" and "sad" directly point towards sadness. While there might be elements of hope or beauty, the primary emotion here seems to be the sorrow associated with such a loss.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, joy, or surprise in the tweet. The focus is on the tragedy and the emotional impact it's having on people, especially the French who are mourning collectively. So, sadness fits best as the intended emotion.
