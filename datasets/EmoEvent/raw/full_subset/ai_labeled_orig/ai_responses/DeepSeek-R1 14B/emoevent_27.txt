Alright, let's try to figure out the emotion behind this tweet about Venezuela. The user is sharing a correction regarding "manipulation" and mentions an armored car running over helpless citizens with a link included.

First, I notice the use of strong words like "RUN OVER" in all caps, which usually indicates some level of anger or frustration. The situation described—armored cars harming civilians—is alarming and likely to evoke negative emotions. The mention of "helpless citizens" adds to the severity, suggesting a sense of powerlessness.

Looking at the options: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet is clearly not expressing joy or surprise; it's more serious. Disgust could be possible if the user feels repelled by the action, but the emphasis seems to be on the violent act rather than a moral judgment. Fear might come into play with the dangerous situation, but again, the strong language points more towards anger.

So, putting it together, the author is likely expressing anger at the violence and manipulation happening in Venezuela.

The tweet describes a violent act involving armored cars running over citizens, which conveys a strong sense of anger due to the use of force against civilians.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet into one of the six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let's break it down.

The tweet says "#Venezuela Correcting manipulation. Armoured car RUN OVER helpless citizens." There's also a link included, which might be a video or image, but since I can't view it, I'll focus on the text.

First, the hashtags and mentions: #Venezuela suggests it's about the current events there, possibly related to the political crisis. "Correcting manipulation" seems like they're calling out misinformation or false narratives, which often indicates frustration or anger towards those spreading lies.

Next, the main part is "Armoured car RUN OVER helpless citizens." The use of capital letters for "RUN OVER" emphasizes urgency and severity. This describes a violent act, likely causing harm to innocent people. Seeing an armored vehicle running over civilians is a graphic image that would evoke strong emotions.

Looking at the emotion categories:

- Anger: Fits because correcting manipulation implies frustration with those in power, and the violence described could be seen as a response to such frustrations.
- Disgust: Could apply if the tweet is about revulsion towards actions, but here it's more about anger towards perpetrators.
- Fear: Not directly conveyed; fear would involve anticipation of danger, not so much a reaction to a violent act itself.
- Joy/sadness/surprise: Clearly not applicable here as the context is negative and involves harm.

So, the emotion here seems to be anger because it's directed at those responsible for the violence, possibly the government or Maduro supporters. The tweet is calling out manipulation and highlighting a violent action, which likely reflects the author's frustration and anger towards the situation in Venezuela.

Okay, so I need to classify a tweet based on the emotion it conveys. The tweet is: "#Venezuela Correcting manipulation. Armoured car RUN OVER helpless citizens. https://t.co/HtDxCuK8Wm". 

First, let me break down what's happening here. The user is talking about Venezuela and mentions an armored car running over helpless citizens. That sounds pretty serious and violent. The word "RUN OVER" in all caps suggests urgency or intensity.

I remember the emotion categories are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Let me think which one fits best. 

The situation described is a harmful act—using an armored car on civilians seems like a harsh response. This could evoke feelings of anger because it's a strong action against innocent people. Alternatively, it might cause disgust because it's a cruel or inhumane act.

Looking at the emotion definitions: Anger includes annoyance and rage, which fits because the user is likely upset about this event. Disgust involves disinterest or dislike, but I think the primary emotion here is more about the strong negative reaction to violence, which aligns with anger rather than disgust.

So, the tweet is expressing outrage over a violent act against civilians, which points towards anger.
