Alright, so I need to classify the emotion of this tweet regarding the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, let me read the tweet carefully: "Ok..I get it that #NotreDameCathedral has been around for over 800 years...but the Earth’s been around for 4.543 billion years. It’s scorched melting, and dying at an apocalyptic pace whilst no one seems to really give a shit! Maybe it needs a rebrand? #NotreDameCathedralFire"

Breaking this down, the author starts by acknowledging the age of the cathedral but then contrasts it with Earth's much longer existence. They describe Earth as being scorched, melting, and dying at an apocalyptic pace. The key part here is "whilst no one seems to really give a shit!" which clearly shows frustration or anger.

The tone isn't expressing disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Instead, it's more about the author being upset that people aren't concerned enough about Earth's state despite its much longer history compared to the cathedral. The sarcasm and exclamation mark emphasize their irritation.

So, the emotion here is definitely anger because of the frustration expressed towards others' lack of concern.

Okay, so I need to classify the emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let's read the tweet carefully.

The user starts with "Ok..I get it that #NotreDameCathedral has been around for over 800 years..." They seem to acknowledge the cathedral's age but then compare it to Earth's age, which is much longer. The tone here might be a bit sarcastic or annoyed because they're pointing out how old the cathedral is, almost as if to downplay its significance.

Then they say, "but the Earth’s been around for 4.543 billion years." This comparison could be highlighting that Earth's issues are more pressing and长久, suggesting maybe the focus on Notre Dame isn't as important in a universal sense.

Next part: "It’s scorched melting, and dying at an apocalyptic pace whilst no one seems to really give a shit!" Here, they're clearly expressing frustration. The use of strong words like "apocalyptic" and "no one seems to really give a shit" indicates anger or annoyance. They feel that while Earth is facing severe problems, people aren't giving it enough attention.

Finally, the user suggests "#NotreDameCathedral might need a rebrand." This could be sarcastic, implying that if the cathedral isn't getting enough attention, maybe changing its image would help. The overall tone here is one of frustration and anger towards what they perceive as misplaced priorities.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger includes annoyance and rage. The tweet uses strong language and sarcasm to express dissatisfaction with how Earth's issues are being overlooked compared to the cathedral fire. There's a sense of irritation and exasperation, which fits under anger.

I don't think it's disgust because they're not expressing dislike towards something specific but rather frustration about the situation. Fear isn't present; there's no indication of worry or anxiety. Joy is obviously out of place here. Sadness could be an option if it were a somber reflection, but the tone is more biting. Surprise doesn't fit either since the user seems informed and critical.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed is anger.

Alright, let me break this down step by step. The user wants me to classify the given tweet into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. 

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says, "Ok..I get it that #NotreDameCathedral has been around for over 800 years...but the Earth’s been around for 4.543 billion years. It’s scorched melting, and dying at an apocalyptic pace whilst no one seems to really give a shit! Maybe it needs a rebrand? #NotreDameCathedralFire"

The user is comparing the age of Notre Dame Cathedral to the Earth's age, highlighting that while the cathedral is old, the Earth has been around much longer. The author mentions the cathedral being scorched and melting, referencing the fire that occurred. They express frustration ("no one seems to really give a shit!") and suggest rebranding as a way to gain attention.

Looking at the emotions:

- **Anger**: The tweet does show frustration with how the situation is being handled, which can fall under anger.
- **Disgust**: There's a sense of disappointment or disgust towards humanity's lack of concern.
- **Sadness**: There might be sadness about the destruction, but the tone here seems more frustrated.
- **Surprise**: Not really applicable here; the frustration is direct.

Between anger and disgust, I think anger fits better because the author is expressing frustration and irritation towards others' inaction. While there's a hint of disgust at humanity's apathy, the primary emotion conveyed is anger due to the strong language used.
