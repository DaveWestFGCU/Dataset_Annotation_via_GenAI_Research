Alright, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me read the tweet carefully.

The user says their pictures can't capture Notre Dame's beauty and they're posting to mourn with others over an impossible loss. The hashtags are #NotreDameCathedralFire. 

Mourning usually implies sadness, right? They're expressing a sense of loss and哀悼，which translates to grief or sorrow. There's no indication of anger or disgust here. Fear would involve anxiety about future events, but the tweet is more about the aftermath. Joy isn't present; they're not happy. Surprise isn't either because it's an expected emotional response.

So the primary emotion here is sadness.

Alright, let's try to figure out which emotion this tweet is conveying. The user mentioned they know their pictures can't capture the beauty of Notre Dame but are posting to mourn with others over an impossible loss. They're clearly expressing a deep sense of sorrow and grief about the event.

Looking at the options: anger isn't present here, no signs of annoyance or rage. Disgust or disinterest also don't fit; it's not about dislike. Fear or anxiety aren't indicated either. There's no joy or serenity in the message. The key emotion here is sadness—mourning and loss are strong indicators of that category.
