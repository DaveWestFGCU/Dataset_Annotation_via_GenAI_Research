Alright, so I need to figure out what emotion the author of this tweet is conveying. The tweet says: "Yes !! #Parents4future in support of #Fridaysforfuture and #SchoolStrike4Climate #GretaThunberg #globalstrike." 

First, let me break down the content. The user is expressing agreement with enthusiasm ("Yes !!"), showing support for several hashtags related to climate strikes. These include "#Parents4future," which I know refers to parents supporting their children's involvement in climate protests; "#Fridaysforfuture" and "#SchoolStrike4Climate," both of which are movements where students skip school to protest climate change; and "#GretaThunberg," the leader of these movements, along with "#globalstrike," indicating a broader, international effort.

The emotion categories I have to choose from are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The tweet doesn't express any negative emotions like anger or fear. There's no indication of dislike or厌恶 (disgust). It also isn't expressing fear or anxiety about climate change—instead, it's a supportive statement.

The user is clearly in agreement and showing enthusiasm, which points to joy. They're using exclamation marks and positive hashtags related to a cause they support. This aligns with the emotion of joy because it reflects satisfaction and happiness in supporting a movement they believe in. There's no element of surprise here; it's a deliberate expression of support.

So, considering all this, the emotion conveyed is joy.

Alright, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a tweet about parents supporting Fridays for Future and Greta Thunberg's movement. I need to classify the emotion behind it from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

First, looking at the tweet: "Yes !! #Parents4future in support of..." The exclamation marks show excitement. They're expressing support for the climate strikes, which is a positive action. So the author seems happy or joyful about being part of this movement.

Next, considering the context. Fridays for Future and SchoolStrike4Climate are movements driven by hope and collective action against climate change. People involved often feel optimistic and united, which aligns with joy.

I should check if any other emotions fit. Anger would be more if they were critical of government inaction, but here it's support. Disgust isn't present since they're expressing approval. Fear or surprise don't seem applicable because the tweet is about ongoing support, not something unexpected. Sadness isn't there either; it's a positive message.

So the emotion conveyed is joy.
