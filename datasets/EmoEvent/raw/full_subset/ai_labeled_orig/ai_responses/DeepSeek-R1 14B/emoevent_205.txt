Alright, so I need to figure out the emotion behind this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet starts with "I knew it .... I knew it .... I knew it!!!", which seems like the person is expressing a strong feeling of confidence or maybe even excitement that their prediction came true. Then they mention that the High Altar is untouched and not even the candles are melted, using emojis like paws up and high five, along with some cat paw emojis. They also thank Sky News and include hashtags related to the event.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The repeated "I knew it" suggests they were expecting this outcome, so maybe they're relieved or happy that their prediction was correct. The positive reaction with high fives and emojis indicates a sense of satisfaction or joy.

They don't seem angry, disgusted, fearful, sad, or surprised‚Äîmore like happy because their expectation came true without any negative consequences mentioned beyond the fire. So I think it's joy.

Okay, I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion conveyed. Let me read through it carefully.

The tweet starts with "I knew it .... I knew it .... I knew it!!!" The repetition emphasizes their certainty or maybe a sense of foreboding. They're expressing that they anticipated something, which might be frustration or relief?

Next, they say "Thank you #SkyNews" and mention that the High Altar is untouched and not even the candles are melted. This seems positive because the main structure and important elements were spared in the fire. The use of emojis like paws up and high five with a cat emoji suggests excitement or happiness.

Putting it all together, the author feels relieved and happy that significant parts of Notre-Dame were saved. They're celebrating the good news despite the tragedy of the fire. So, the emotion here is joy.
