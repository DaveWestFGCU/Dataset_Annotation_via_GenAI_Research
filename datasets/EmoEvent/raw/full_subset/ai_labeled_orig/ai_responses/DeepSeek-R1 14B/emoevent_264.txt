Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion is conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet says: "Brilliant and an emotional episode #GameofThrones especially with #LyannaMormont. She may have been the youngest but she stood her ground & defeated a terrible threat (giant) to which I'm confident strategically speaking benefited the chances of "the living side!" #GirlPower https://t.co/RqRMTP36JW"

Alright, let me break this down. The user is talking about an episode being "brilliant" and "emotional." They mention Lyanna Mormont specifically. She's described as the youngest but standing her ground and defeating a giant, which benefited the living side. They also add #GirlPower.

So, the emotions here... They're calling it brilliant, which is positive—so that might hint at joy or surprise. Emotional could go either way, but given the context of defeating a threat, it's probably more on the positive side.

The tweet highlights Lyanna's bravery and strategic victory. The use of "girl power" suggests admiration for her strength and success against odds. So, the author seems to be expressing pride and positivity towards her actions.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger is not here; the tone isn't upset. Disgust or dislike? No, they're praising. Fear? Doesn't seem so—it's about overcoming a threat. Sadness? Not really, unless it was a sad moment, but overall it's positive. Surprise could be there because of an unexpected victory, but I think joy fits better because they're celebrating her success and the episode being emotional in a good way.

So, the emotion is likely joy.

Breaking down emotions: The words "brilliant" and "emotional" suggest positive feelings. Highlighting Lyanna's bravery and victory over a threat is uplifting. The confidence in how it benefited their side adds to that positive sentiment. Using #GirlPower also conveys pride and positivity.

Alright, let's tackle this query. The user has provided a tweet about Game of Thrones and wants it classified into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It mentions an "emotional episode" with Lyanna Mormont, highlighting her bravery against a giant. The author expresses confidence in how this event benefits the living side and ends with #GirlPower. 

The key words here are "brilliant," "emotional," "stood her ground," "defeated a terrible threat," and positive reinforcement like "strategically speaking benefited" and "#GirlPower." These all convey positivity and pride.

Looking at the emotion categories, joy fits because of the praise and the enthusiastic tone. There's no sign of anger or disgust; fear isn't present since it's about overcoming a threat. Sadness is absent too. Surprise could be a contender if the outcome was unexpected, but the tweet seems more celebratory than surprised.

So, the emotion here is joy.
