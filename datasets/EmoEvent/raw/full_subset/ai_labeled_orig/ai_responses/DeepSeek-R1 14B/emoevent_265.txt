Alright, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion. The tweet says: "Rule number 1......If the U.S government say its right then it is most definately WRONG #Venezuela." 

First, let me understand what the tweet is about. It seems to be talking about Venezuela's political situation, specifically regarding who is the legitimate president between Maduro and Guaido. The user mentions "Rule number 1" and expresses disagreement with the U.S government's stance.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

The author is clearly disagreeing with the US government's position on Venezuela. They use strong words like "wrong," which indicates a negative sentiment. The use of "most definately" (probably meant to be "definitely") emphasizes their conviction. 

I don't see any signs of fear or anxiety here; it's more about disagreement rather than worry. There's no joy or serenity, so those can be ruled out. Sadness might be a possibility if they're upset about the situation, but the strong wording and direct contradiction point more to anger.

Disgust is also possible because they are showing aversion towards the US government's stance. However, disgust often involves feelings of revulsion or dislike for something specific, whereas anger here seems more about opposition to a policy or statement.

Comparing anger and disgust: The tweet expresses frustration and opposition, which aligns with anger. Disgust might be more about finding something repulsive, but the context is more about disagreeing strongly, hence anger makes more sense.

So, I think the emotion conveyed here is **anger**.

Alright, let's try to figure out what emotion this tweet is conveying. The user has given me a specific task: classify the emotion of a tweet based on a list of categories—anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully: "Rule number 1......If the U.S government say its right then it is most definately WRONG #Venezuela". The author seems to be expressing strong opposition to the U.S. government's stance on Venezuela. They're using words like "definately" (though maybe they meant "definitely") and capitalizing "WRONG", which emphasizes their point.

The hashtag at the end, #Venezuela, indicates that the tweet is about the ongoing political situation there. From the context provided earlier, it's a crisis where Nicolas Maduro and Juan Guaido are vying for legitimacy as president.

Looking at the emotion categories:

- **Anger**: The tweet expresses strong disagreement with the U.S government's position. Words like "WRONG" suggest frustration or irritation.
- **Disgust**: Not so much about disgust, which is more about aversion to something恶心. This seems more about opposition rather than disgust.
- **Fear**: There's no indication of fear here; it's more about defiance.
- **Joy/Serenity**: Definitely not, as the tone is negative.
- **Sadness/Grief**: The author isn't expressing sadness but rather anger at what they perceive as a wrong stance.
- **Surprise**: No element of surprise in the tweet.

So, the emotion here seems to be **anger**. The author is clearly annoyed or upset with the U.S government's position on Venezuela.

The tweet expresses strong opposition and frustration towards the U.S. government's stance on Venezuela, using emphatic language like "WRONG." This conveys **anger**.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion. The tweet says: "Rule number 1......If the U.S government say its right then it is most definately WRONG #Venezuela". 

First, let me break down what's being expressed here. The author is talking about a rule regarding the Venezuelan crisis and the U.S. government's stance. They're disagreeing strongly with the U.S., calling their position "most definately WRONG". That definitely has some strong language.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to figure out which one fits best.

The tweet isn't expressing fear or sadness. It's more about reacting to a statement rather than feeling anxious or grieving. Surprise is also not it because the author seems to have a strong opinion against what's being said.

Disgust could be possible since they're dismissing something as wrong, but let me think. Disgust often involves disapproval or aversion towards something perceived as bad. In this case, the author is expressing clear disagreement and opposition to the U.S. government's position.

Alternatively, anger might fit because they are strongly opposing and using intense language like "wrong". The use of "most definately" adds emphasis, indicating strong frustration or irritation.

So between anger and disgust: Disgust is more about feeling something is repulsive, while anger is about the emotional response to something wrong. Here, the author is reacting with opposition and vehemence, which points more towards anger.

I think the emotion here is **anger** because of the strong, opposing language used against the U.S. government's stance.

**anger**
