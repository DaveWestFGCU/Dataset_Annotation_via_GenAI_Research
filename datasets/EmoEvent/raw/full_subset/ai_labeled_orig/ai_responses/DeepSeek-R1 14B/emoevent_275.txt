Alright, so I need to figure out the emotion behind this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the tweet says that Notre Dame will be repaired using taxpayer money and turned into a "shared cultural space," which the author implies will result in it becoming a mosque. The user is linking this to hashtags related to the cathedral's fire and some Catholic Twitter topics.

I should consider the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I'm looking for the most relevant one.

The tweet seems critical of the idea of repairing Notre Dame as a shared space, possibly suggesting it might be repurposed in a way the author disagrees with. The use of "and that is how it will become a mosque" sounds like a prediction or complaint about the direction it's taking. This could indicate frustration or anger because the author seems upset about the potential change.

I don't detect any signs of fear, as there's no indication of threat or danger. There's no joy or surprise, so those can be ruled out. Sadness might come into play if someone is mourning the loss, but here it's more about a reaction to a proposed action rather than the event itself. Disgust could be a possibility, but the main emotion seems more directed at the decision-making process rather than something revolting.

So, putting it all together, the author is likely expressing anger towards the idea of taxpayer funds being used and the potential transformation into a mosque.

Alright, I need to classify this tweet into one of the given emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let's read the tweet carefully.

The tweet says, "Notre Dame Will Be Repaired at Taxpayer Expense, but as a 'Shared Cultural Space'. And That Is How It Become a Mosque." There's also a link and some hashtags related to Notre-Dame Cathedral Fire, WednesdayWisdom, and CatholicTwitter.

First, I notice the mention of repairing Notre-Dame at taxpayer expense. The author seems critical about this decision, possibly feeling that it's not justifiable or that funds are being misused. Then, the tweet suggests that this is how it becomes a mosque, which might imply a change in purpose or ownership, something the author disapproves of.

Considering the emotions, anger often comes into play when someone is upset about a decision they believe is wrong or unfair. The mention of taxpayers' money and turning it into a mosque could be seen as provocative or frustrating to the author. There's a sense of frustration or irritation here, which aligns with anger.

Disgust is another emotion but usually involves feelings like dislike or aversion towards something恶心的，but in this case, it's more about being upset over a decision rather than something morally repugnant.

Fear isn't evident here; the tweet doesn't express worry or anxiety. Joy and surprise are clearly not present as the tone is negative. Sadness might be an option if someone is mourning the loss of Notre-Dame, but the focus seems to be more on the repair's purpose rather than grief over the destruction.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed here is likely anger due to the critical stance towards the decision and the implication about converting the site into a mosque.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion it conveys using only the categories provided: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Let me read through the tweet again and analyze the content.

The tweet says, "Notre Dame Will Be Repaired at Taxpayer Expense, but as a 'Shared Cultural Space'. And That Is How It Become a Mosque." The link is probably related to this topic, possibly an article or opinion piece. The hashtags used are #NotreDameCathedralFire, #WednesdayWisdom, and #CatholicTwitter.

First, I should consider the content. The author is talking about Notre Dame being repaired with taxpayer money but mentions it becoming a "shared cultural space" and specifically a mosque. This seems like a commentary on how the reconstruction might change its identity or use.

Looking at the emotion categories:

- Anger: If the tweet expresses frustration or irritation.
- Disgust: Might be if there's a strong dislike or aversion to the idea.
- Fear: Perhaps anxiety about future changes.
- Joy: Doesn't seem to fit here as it's not positive.
- Sadness: Could relate to grief over loss, but more focused on the change in use.
- Surprise: If it's an unexpected twist.

The tweet is making a statement that Notre Dame will be transformed into something else. The author seems critical of the idea of turning it into a mosque, which might be seen as disrespectful or unwanted by some. So, this could express disgust because they likely dislike this proposed change and have strong negative feelings about it. Alternatively, anger could also be possible if they're frustrated with how funds are being used or decisions made.

But I think disgust is more appropriate here because the author seems to find the idea repulsive or unacceptable rather than just being angry. Disgust can encompass disapproval of an action or proposal.
