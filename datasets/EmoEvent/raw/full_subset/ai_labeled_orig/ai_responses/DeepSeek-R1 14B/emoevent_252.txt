Alright, let's break this down. I need to classify the given tweet's emotion from the list provided: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

First, the tweet is "#GretaThunberg minors please note potty language is used for puncuation! https://t.co/tmYUvXXo6w". So it's about Greta Thunberg and mentions using "potty language" for punctuation. 

I know Greta Thunberg is known for her passionate climate activism, often speaking out against government inaction. The mention of potty language likely refers to her strong or foul-mouthed remarks, which she sometimes uses to emphasize her points.

Now, looking at the emotion categories:

- Anger: This could fit if the tweet is criticizing Greta's approach.
- Disgust: If someone finds using such language unpleasant.
- Fear: Doesn't seem relevant here.
- Joy: Unlikely in this context.
- Sadness: Not directly related to the content.
- Surprise: Maybe, but it's more about the use of strong language.

The tweet is pointing out that Greta uses potty language for punctuation. It seems like a critique or maybe a criticism of her communication style. So the emotion here is likely one of disapproval or dislike, which falls under disgust in this context.

Alright, let's try to figure out what emotion the author of this tweet is conveying. The tweet says: "#GretaThunberg minors please note potty language is used for puncuation! https://t.co/tmYUvXXo6w". 

First, I notice that it's a message addressed to minors, warning them about "potty language" being used for punctuation in the link. That seems like a heads-up or maybe a criticism. The mention of Greta Thunberg is interesting because she's known for her climate activism and has sparked significant discussions and reactions.

The author could be pointing out that using such language might not be appropriate, especially considering Greta's movement, which is all about serious issues like climate change. This suggests the author might disapprove of the language used in the linked content, possibly feeling it's disrespectful or not fitting for the context.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet isn't expressing any positive emotions like joy or serenity. It's not showing fear or anxiety either. There's no indication of surprise or amazement here.

The mention of potty language and its inappropriateness could imply a sense of disgust or dislike towards the content linked. Disgust often includes feelings of disapproval, which fits because the author is pointing out something they find distasteful. Alternatively, it might be frustration (which falls under anger), but since the focus is more on the content being disagreeable rather than an aggressive reaction, I think disgust is a better fit.

So, considering all this, the emotion here seems to be disgust.

Okay, so I need to classify a tweet based on the emotion it conveys. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me look at the tweet again: "#GretaThunberg minors please note potty language is used for puncuation! https://t.co/tmYUvXXo6w"

Hmm, first, I notice that the user is addressing minors and mentioning "potty language." That seems like a warning or advice. The mention of Greta Thunberg might be related to her activism, but in this context, it's just a hashtag. 

The main point here is about using potty language for punctuation. Potty language usually refers to swearing or vulgar words. So the tweet is advising minors that such language is used for punctuation, which I think means emphasizing points strongly, maybe sarcastically.

I'm trying to figure out the emotion behind this. The user seems to be informing or warning minors about something. Is it concern? Maybe they're worried that using such language might affect minors. But the options don't include concern directly; so perhaps looking at other emotions.

The use of exclamation and a link suggests they might be pointing out something, possibly in a sarcastic way. So maybe there's an element of sarcasm or mockery here. If someone is mocking Greta Thunberg or her movement by using such language, that could indicate anger or disgust.

Wait, but the tweet isn't directly attacking Greta; it's more about advising minors on their language usage. Maybe the user is frustrated with how people are communicating, hence the mention of potty language for punctuation. That frustration could be a form of anger or maybe disgust at the use of such language.

Alternatively, if someone is surprised that potty language is being used for punctuation, it might fall under surprise. But I think the tone here is more cautionary rather than amazed.

So considering all this, the emotion is likely disgust because they're pointing out something they find distasteful or unacceptableâ€”using inappropriate language, especially around minors. Disgust can include dislike or disapproval, which fits here.
