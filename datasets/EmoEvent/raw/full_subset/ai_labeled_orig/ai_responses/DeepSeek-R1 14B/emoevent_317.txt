Alright, let's try to figure out the emotion in this tweet. The user is talking about Game of Thrones, specifically last night's episode. They mention that they don't know what others are talking about because for them, it was one of the best episodes ever. 

They describe it as creating "so much emotion and stress" and say they loved every second. So, breaking this down, the key words here are "emotion," "stress," and "loved." The person is expressing a strong positive feeling but also acknowledges that it was stressful or emotionally intense.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger isn't there because there's no frustration or rage. Disgust? No, they didn't express dislike. Fear? Maybe not directly about fear but more about the emotional impact. Joy fits here because they loved every second, even though it was stressful. Sadness doesn't seem to apply since they're expressing joy and excitement. Surprise could be a contender if it's about being amazed, but the main emotion seems to be positive enjoyment.

So, considering all this, the most fitting emotion is joy.

The tweet expresses enthusiasm and love for an episode, indicating **joy** despite mentioning stress, which is part of the emotional intensity they enjoyed. 

**joy**

Okay, let me try to figure out the emotion in this tweet. The user is talking about Game of Thrones' last episode, saying it was one of the best they've ever seen. They mention that it created a lot of emotion and stress, which suggests they felt something intense while watching. They also express love for every second of it. 

So, looking at the possible emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet is positive because they loved the episode. Words like "emotion" and "stress" might imply a mix of feelings but in a good way. The overall tone seems exhilarated or thrilled. Since joy includes serenity and ecstasy, that fits here because they were really moved and happy about the show.

**joy**

Alright, let's break down this problem step by step. The task is to classify a given tweet into one of six predefined emotional categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully:

"Don’t know what some of y’all are talking about but last nights GOT was one of the best episodes I’ve ever seen. Of anything. It created so much emotion and stress. I loved every second of it #gameofthrones"

The author is expressing their opinion on the latest episode of Game of Thrones. They mention that it's "one of the best episodes" they've ever seen, which immediately suggests a positive sentiment.

Next, they talk about the show creating "so much emotion and stress." While "stress" might seem negative, in this context, the author is referring to the emotional intensity of the episode, not personal stress. This indicates that the emotions evoked by the show are significant and impactful.

The phrase "I loved every second of it" is a strong indicator of positive feelings towards the episode. The use of "loved" clearly conveys joy or satisfaction.

Looking at the emotion categories:

- Anger: There's no indication of anger or frustration in the tweet.
- Disgust: No signs of dislike or aversion are present.
- Fear: While stress is mentioned, it's more about the emotional impact rather than fear itself.
- Joy: The author expresses clear enjoyment and love for the episode, fitting well under joy.
- Sadness: There’s no sadness expressed; instead, there's positive sentiment.
- Surprise: The tweet doesn't convey surprise but rather appreciation.

Therefore, the emotion conveyed here is joy. The author's enthusiasm and praise for the episode align with feelings of happiness and satisfaction.

**joy**

The tweet conveys **joy** as the author expresses enthusiasm and love for the episode, highlighting its emotional impact positively.
