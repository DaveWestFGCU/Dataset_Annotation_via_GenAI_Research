Alright, let's take a look at this query. The user wants me to classify a tweet based on the emotion conveyed, choosing from anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully: "On the #WorldBookDay , I would like every book lover/reader to please comment your favourite book here. I would love hear the names of all the good books & would try to read them. Thanks." 

The author is encouraging others to share their favorite books and expresses a desire to read them. The language used is positive and inviting. Words like "would love" and "please comment" show enthusiasm and excitement about reading.

I need to consider which emotion fits best. Anger isn't present here; the tone is far from annoyed or enraged. Disgust also doesn't apply since there's no indication of dislike or disinterest. Fear and surprise aren't evident eitherâ€”there's no sense of worry or astonishment in the message.

Sadness isn't the right choice because the tweet isn't expressing grief or pensiveness. That leaves joy, which encompasses serenity and ecstasy. The author seems happy and eager to engage with others about books, which aligns with joy.

I think the emotion conveyed here is definitely joy. They're spreading positivity and excitement around reading on World Book Day.
