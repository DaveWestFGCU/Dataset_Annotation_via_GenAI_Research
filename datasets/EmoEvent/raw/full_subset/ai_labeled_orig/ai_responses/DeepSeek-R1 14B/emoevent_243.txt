Okay, let me try to figure out the emotion in this tweet. The user is talking about their favorite spot to curl up with a good book on World Book Day. They mentioned it's one of their favorites and included a book emoji. Their use of positive language like "favourite" suggests they're happy or enjoy the experience. There's no indication of any negative emotions, so I don't think it's anger, disgust, fear, or sadness. They might be expressing surprise if something unexpected happened, but it doesn't seem to be the case here. The overall tone is positive and joyful.

Alright, let's break down this query. The user wants me to classify a tweet based on the emotion it conveys using specific categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says, "This will forever be one of our favourite spots to curl up with a good book ðŸ“š #WorldBookDay USER https://t.co/URrkyE9z8m"

The key words here are "favourite spots" and "curl up with a good book." The use of a book emoji reinforces the positive sentiment. The author is expressing that this spot is particularly enjoyable for reading, which is a pleasant activity.

Looking at the emotion categories, joy fits because they're talking about something they love doing. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or disgust. No signs of fear, sadness, or surprise either.

So, the emotion conveyed here is definitely joy.
