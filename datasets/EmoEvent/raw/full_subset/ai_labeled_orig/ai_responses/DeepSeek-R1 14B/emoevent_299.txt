Alright, I need to figure out the emotion conveyed in this tweet regarding the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user provided a list of emotions to choose from: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

Looking at the tweet: "10th Church vandalized in France this week... Why can’t people just chill? Fuck... #NotreDameCathedralFire..." 

The first part mentions multiple church vandalisms, and the author expresses frustration with "Why can't people just chill?" followed by the word "Fuck...", which clearly shows anger. The hashtags also relate to the Notre Dame fire, indicating concern over repeated incidents.

So the emotion here is primarily **anger**.

Alright, let's try to figure out the emotion behind this tweet. The user is talking about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire and mentions that it's the 10th church vandalized in France this week. They express frustration with "Why can’t people just chill?" and use the word "Fuck..." which shows strong negative feelings.

Looking at the options: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The frustration and explicit language point towards anger. They're upset about the situation and seem annoyed or enraged by the repeated acts of vandalism. There's no indication of disgust, fear, joy, or surprise; it's more about their irritation and outrage.

So, I think the emotion here is anger.

Alright, so I need to classify a tweet based on the emotion it conveys. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me look at the tweet again: "10th Church vandalized in France this week... Why can’t people just chill? Fuck... #NotreDameCathedralFire #Frace #FreeFrance #Notre_dame_de_Paris #News #Online https://t.co/fI56U4qjgv". 

First, the tweet mentions that it's the 10th church vandalized in France this week. That's a lot of vandalism, which suggests something negative is happening. The author then says "Why can’t people just chill?" which sounds frustrated or annoyed. They follow up with "Fuck...", which is a strong expression of anger.

Looking at the emotion options: anger includes annoyance and rage, so that fits. Disgust might be if they were talking about something revolting, but it's more frustration here. Fear would involve worry or anxiety, but I don't see that in the tweet. Joy and surprise are clearly not applicable since the tone is negative.

So, putting it all together, the emotion is anger because of the frustration and use of profanity.
