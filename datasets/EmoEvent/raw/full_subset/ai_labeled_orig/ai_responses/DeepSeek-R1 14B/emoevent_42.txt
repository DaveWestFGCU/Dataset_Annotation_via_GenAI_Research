Alright, let me try to figure out the emotion behind this tweet. The user is talking about Venezuelan Zumba dancers and friends being "very pissed off." That's a direct indication of anger right there. They mention having access to guns and suggest taking extreme action against Maduro in broad daylight, referencing Khashoggi which implies assassination. The overall tone is intense and vengeful, which definitely falls under anger. No other emotions like fear or surprise seem to be present here.

Alright, I need to classify the emotion conveyed in this tweet about Venezuela's political crisis. The user mentions "very pissed off" Venezuelan Zumba dancers and their friends, which clearly indicates anger. They also talk about having access to guns and making a drastic statement referencing Khashoggi, suggesting a strong negative sentiment towards Maduro.

The primary emotion here is definitely anger. There are elements of threat and revenge, but those fall under the broader category of anger rather than fear or surprise.
