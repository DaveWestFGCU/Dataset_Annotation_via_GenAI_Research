Alright, I need to classify the emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The tweet says, "Like a bombing" and includes a link to a daylight reveal of the damage. The phrase "like a bombing" suggests shock or astonishment because it's comparing the destruction to something severe like an explosion. So, the emotion here is surprise.

Alright, I need to classify the emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Looking at the tweet: it's using the hashtag #NotreDameCathedralFire and says, "'Like a bombing': Daylight reveals extent of Notre-Dame damage" with a link. 

The phrase "Like a bombing" suggests that the speaker is comparing the destruction to something severe and intentional, which might imply anger or frustration. However, the overall message seems more about conveying the shocking reality of the damage rather than personal anger.

Considering the options, sadness makes sense because the fire caused significant loss, likely evoking grief for the historic cathedral's destruction. While there's a comparison to a bombing, it's not expressing personal annoyance but highlighting the devastation, which aligns with sadness.

**sadness**

Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion behind this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let me start by reading the tweet carefully.

The tweet says: "#NotreDameCathedralFire 'Like a bombing': Daylight reveals extent of Notre-Dame damage https://t.co/XaoHhS0WWf"

First, the hashtag is straightforward— it's about the cathedral fire. The main text starts with "Like a bombing," which immediately makes me think of something catastrophic or destructive. The phrase suggests that the damage was so severe that it's being compared to an explosion, which implies a significant amount of destruction.

Next, "Daylight reveals extent of Notre-Dame damage" indicates that after dark or when it wasn't as visible before, now with daylight, people can see just how bad the situation is. This part adds to the severity because seeing the full extent usually brings a stronger emotional response than not knowing the full picture.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to pick one that best fits. 

The phrase "Like a bombing" suggests shock and disbelief, but also sadness because it's about the destruction of something significant. The comparison to a bombing is strong and evokes a sense of loss or grief. However, it might also induce fear if someone is worried about similar events happening elsewhere.

But considering the context—this is about a historic building that was destroyed by fire—the primary emotion people would feel is likely sadness due to the loss and destruction. There's an element of surprise because it's such a notable place being damaged in such a dramatic way, but I think the main emotion here is sadness.

Wait, could it be fear? The tweet mentions daylight revealing the extent, which might make someone anxious about the future or worried for what comes next, like repairs or safety. But the primary reaction to the event itself would probably be sadness over the loss.

So I'm leaning towards sadness because it's more about mourning the destruction rather than fear of future events.
