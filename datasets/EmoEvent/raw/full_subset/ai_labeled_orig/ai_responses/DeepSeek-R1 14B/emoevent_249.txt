Okay, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Let me read the tweet again.

The tweet says, "Here’s to all the badass bitches in Westeros #GameOfThrones #BattleForWinterfell https://t.co/S6WWoKir4Q". Hmm, "badass bitches" sounds positive. The use of "Here’s to all" is like a toast or praise. They're celebrating these strong women in Westeros.

The hashtags are about Game of Thrones and the Battle for Winterfell, which were major events in the series. This seems like someone is excited or happy about the characters or the show's elements. There's no negative language here; it's all admiration.

Looking at the emotion list: anger doesn't fit because there's nothing upset or annoyed. Disgust? No, they're not expressing dislike. Fear or surprise? The tweet isn't reacting to something unexpected or scary. Sadness is out of place since the tone is positive.

So joy makes sense here—praising and celebrating badass women in a beloved show. They're showing appreciation and excitement.

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion is being conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says: "Here’s to all the badass bitches in Westeros #GameOfThrones #BattleForWinterfell". Hmm.

First, let's break it down. The phrase "Here’s to" usually indicates a toast or praise, which is positive. "Badass bitches" clearly isn't literal; it's slang for tough, cool women. So the author is celebrating strong female characters in Westeros. 

The hashtags are #GameOfThrones and #BattleForWinterfell, both related to the show's events, specifically a major battle. The tone seems enthusiastic, maybe even excited or proud.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I don't see any signs of anger or disgust here; it's more about admiration. Fear? Not really, unless they're anxious about the battle outcome, but that doesn't seem to be the focus. Sadness is unlikely since it's a positive statement.

So, joy seems right because they're praising and celebrating something they love—loyal fans of the show would feel happy talking about their favorite characters and moments. Surprise? Maybe not, unless there was an unexpected twist, but the tweet doesn't mention anything like that.

Therefore, the emotion is joy.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion it conveys. The tweet says: "Here’s to all the badass bitches in Westeros #GameOfThrones #BattleForWinterfell". 

First, I should break down what's being expressed here. The phrase "Here’s to" is commonly used to toast or celebrate something, which usually has a positive tone. "Badass bitches" is slang for strong, confident women, so it's probably meant as a compliment. Using the hashtag #BattleForWinterfell refers to an important battle in the series, and since the last season premiered in April 2019, the tweet might be reflecting on that.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tone here seems celebratory and praising, which leans towards joy or serenity. There's no indication of negative emotions like anger or disgust, nor any feelings of fear or sadness. Surprise doesn't quite fit because it's more about acknowledging something positive rather than being amazed by an unexpected event.

So, the emotion conveyed is likely joy.
