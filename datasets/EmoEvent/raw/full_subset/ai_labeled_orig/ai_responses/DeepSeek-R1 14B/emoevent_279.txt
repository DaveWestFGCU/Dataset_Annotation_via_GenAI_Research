Record: "Another #GameofThrones complaint: the battle for the throne is supposed to be a subplot in relation to the ultimate clash between ice and fire, and should have been redefined not only politically but metaphysically by the larger demand that all ally against the Dead."

Alright, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Let me start by reading the tweet carefully.

The tweet is talking about #GameofThrones and mentions a complaint regarding the battle for the throne being a subplot instead of being redefined politically and metaphysically to unite against the Dead. The user seems critical here.

Breaking it down, the author is expressing dissatisfaction with how the show handled certain elements. They're pointing out that the battle for the throne wasn't as central as it should have been compared to the larger conflict between ice and fire. This suggests they expected more depth or significance in the political and metaphysical aspects of the series.

Now, considering the emotions: anger involves annoyance or irritation, which might fit if the author is frustrated. Disgust includes dislike or disinterest, which could apply here since the tweet expresses a negative opinion about how the plot was handled. Sadness would be more about grief or pensiveness, but I don't sense that in this tweet. Fear and surprise aren't really present either.

The key here is that the author is complaining and pointing out what they perceive as a flaw in the show's structure. They're not expressing anger explicitly but are clearly dissatisfied, which leans towards disgust because it's more about disliking something or feeling it was handled poorly.

So, I think the emotion here is **disgust**.

**disgust**

Alright, so I need to classify this tweet about Game of Thrones into one of the given emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me read the tweet again carefully.

The tweet says: "Another #GameofThrones complaint: the battle for the throne is supposed to be a subplot in relation to the ultimate clash between ice and fire, and should have been redefined not only politically but metaphysically by the larger demand that all ally against the Dead."

Hmm. The author is talking about complaints regarding Game of Thrones. They mention that the battle for the throne was a subplot but feels it wasn't handled correctly. They argue that it should've been redefined both politically and metaphysically, emphasizing the need for everyone to unite against the Dead.

The key here is the use of "complaint." This indicates dissatisfaction or frustration with how the show handled certain elements. The author isn't expressing joy or surprise; instead, they're pointing out what they perceive as a flaw in the series' structure.

So, considering the emotions listed: anger involves irritation or annoyance, which seems to fit here because the tweet is a critique or complaint. Disgust relates more to dislike for something repulsive, but this isn't about that. Fear and surprise aren't present. Sadness could be if they were mourning, but it's more of an annoyed frustration.

Therefore, the emotion conveyed here is anger.

**anger**

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet about Game of Thrones based on the emotion it conveys. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, let's read the tweet again carefully. It says: "Another #GameofThrones complaint: the battle for the throne is supposed to be a subplot in relation to the ultimate clash between ice and fire, and should have been redefined not only politically but metaphysically by the larger demand that all ally against the Dead."

Hmm, the user starts with "complaint," which immediately makes me think they're expressing some negative feelings. They're talking about the battle for the throne being a subplot but feel it wasn't handled correctly. The words "should have been" suggest they have expectations that weren't met.

They mention that the battle should have been redefined both politically and metaphysically, which indicates a deeper dissatisfaction with how the show's themes were portrayed. They also talk about all allies uniting against the Dead, implying perhaps the show didn't fulfill this aspect as it could have.

So, putting this together, they're frustrated or annoyed that an important element wasn't addressed properly in the series. That points more towards anger rather than other emotions like disgust or sadness. There's no indication of fear or surprise here; it's a critique with a critical tone.

I think the emotion is **anger** because they're complaining and expressing dissatisfaction about how a key plot was handled.
