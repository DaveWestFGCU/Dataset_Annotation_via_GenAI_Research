Alright, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion based on the given categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Let me look at the tweet again.

The user says, "Books not only give us knowledge but also it gives us information that internet cannot give. Also books are the primary source of all things, from facts to fictions, from knowledge to wisdom." They're talking about World Book Day with a hashtag. 

Hmm, the tone here is positive and appreciative. Theyâ€™re highlighting the value of books over the internet, which shows they think highly of books. Words like "knowledge," "information," "wisdom" are all positive. There's no negative language or any indication of sadness or anger.

I don't see any signs of surprise either; it's more of a declarative statement. Fear? No, nothing related to fear here. Disgust is also not present because they're praising books. So the emotion left is joy. The user seems to be expressing happiness and satisfaction about the importance and benefits of books.

Yeah, I think the emotion here is joy.

Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this tweet's emotion. The user is talking about books and their importance, mentioning that they provide knowledge and information that the internet can't. They also highlight that books are a primary source of facts, fictions, knowledge, and wisdom.

First, I'll look for any obvious emotions in the words used. Words like "give us knowledge," "information the internet cannot give" suggest appreciation and value towards books. The tone seems positive because they're emphasizing the unique benefits of books over other sources.

Next, considering the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. There's no indication of any negative emotions here. The user isn't expressing frustration or disappointment (anger), nor are there signs of dislike or aversion (disgust). They're not showing anxiety or terror (fear) either.

Looking at positive emotions, the tweet exudes a sense of appreciation and admiration for books. The mention of facts, fictions, knowledge, and wisdom suggests a deep respect, which aligns with joy. Joy here isn't just happiness but also includes feelings like serenity or ecstasy, which can encompass a profound appreciation for something.

There's no element of surprise in the tweet; it's more of a declarative statement about the value of books rather than expressing astonishment. Sadness is out of the question as there are no sad undertones.

So putting it all together, the emotion conveyed here is joy because the author is celebrating and highlighting the positive aspects of books.
