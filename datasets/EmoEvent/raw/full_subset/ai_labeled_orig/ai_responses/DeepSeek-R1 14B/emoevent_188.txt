Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion is conveyed in this tweet about the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire. The tweet says: "As a History Nerd I am beyond horrified at the tragic fire that has burnt down a work of history. Pray for France and the magnificent Cathedral that was lost. It was a dream of mine to be able to see Notre Dame."

Alright, first, let me break this down. The author is expressing strong emotions about the fire. They mention being "horrified," which immediately makes me think of fear or shock. But wait, in the list provided, the options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise.

The word "horrified" does fall under fear because it's a feeling of intense worry or distress caused by something可怕 (terrible) happening. So that's one point towards fear.

Then, they talk about the fire burning down a work of history. The cathedral is significant culturally and historically, so the author feels its loss deeply. They express this by saying it was a "dream" to see Notre Dame, which implies personal significance. This adds to the sense of loss, which relates to sadness.

Now, the tweet combines elements of both fear (horrified) and sadness (mourning the loss). But I have to choose only one emotion from the given list. Which is more dominant here?

The use of "horrified" suggests an immediate reaction to the disaster—fear in response to the tragedy. On the other hand, sadness comes from the loss itself. However, fear often includes elements of worry and anxiety about what happened or could happen next, which seems to fit here.

Wait, but sometimes when something tragic happens, people feel a mix of emotions. But I need to pick one that's most relevant. The author is reacting to the event as it's happening, so their primary emotion might be fear because they're horrified by the disaster. Sadness is also present, but perhaps the initial reaction is more fear.

Alternatively, maybe the predominant emotion is sadness because of the loss of something important. They mention praying for France and the cathedral, which can indicate a sense of grief or mourning.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me look at the exact wording again: "I am beyond horrified." That's a strong indicator that fear is the primary emotion here. The word "horrified" directly points to fear. So even though there's sadness in the message, the explicit use of "horrified" makes fear the most appropriate classification.

Therefore, I think the correct emotion here is fear.

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion the author is conveying in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Looking at the tweet: "As a History Nerd I am beyond horrified at the tragic fire that has burnt down a work of history. Pray for France and the magnificent Cathedral that was lost. It was a dream of mine to be able to see Notre Dame."

The key words here are "horrified," "tragic fire," "burnt down," and expressing deep regret about losing a historical site that was a personal aspiration.

"Horrified" immediately makes me think of fear, but wait—no, more accurately, horror can tie into both fear and sadness. However, in this context, the author is reacting to the destruction of something significant, which likely evokes sadness because they're mourning the loss. The use of words like "tragic," "lost," and expressing that it was a personal dream adds to the sense of sorrow.

So while there's an element of horror or shock (which could be surprise), the primary emotion seems to be sadness because they're grieving over the loss. Therefore, the most relevant emotion here is sadness.

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion this tweet is conveying. Let's read it carefully.

The user starts by saying they're "beyond horrified" at the tragic fire that destroyed a historical work. They mention praying for France and the lost cathedral, which was a lifelong dream to see. The hashtags also reference the Notre Dame Cathedral Fire.

So, breaking down the emotions: "horrified" clearly points to fear, but in this context, it's more about the devastation caused by the fire. Fear is often linked to worry or terror, but here it's the fear of losing something significant and feeling the impact of a disaster.

Alternatively, could it be sadness? The user does express loss and grief, which are part of sadness. However, "horrified" leans more towards fear because it's about being terrified by the event itself.

Looking at other emotions: anger isn't present, nor is disgust or joy. Surprise might come into play with such a tragic event, but the primary emotion here seems to be the fear and horror caused by the destruction.

The tweet expresses "horrified," which falls under **fear** due to the terror associated with the disaster.
