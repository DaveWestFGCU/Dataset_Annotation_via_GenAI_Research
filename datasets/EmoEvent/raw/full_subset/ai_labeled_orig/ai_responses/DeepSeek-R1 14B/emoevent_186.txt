Alright, let me try to figure out the emotion in this tweet. The user is talking about people worrying about Avengers Endgame spoilers but not caring about Game of Thrones spoilers. They're frustrated that no one cared about GoT and are calling others hypocrites.

Hmm, so they're clearly upset because they feel like their opinion or interest isn't being acknowledged. Words like "fucks sake" show anger. The sarcasm towards hypocrites also adds to the frustration. So I think the emotion here is anger.

The author expresses frustration and annoyance towards people's lack of concern for Game of Thrones spoilers compared to Avengers Endgame, using strong language and calling others hypocrites.

**anger**

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a tweet and wants it classified into one of the given emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, looking at the tweet: "Everyone worrying about #AvengersEndgame spoilers but fucks sake noone gave two shits about spoiling #GameofThrones thanks a lot hypocrites I know you all watched bith". 

The author is expressing frustration. They're upset that people are more concerned about spoilers for Avengers than for Game of Thrones, which just finished its last season in April 2019. The use of words like "fucks sake" and calling others "hypocrites" shows strong irritation.

I should consider each emotion category. Is it anger? Yes, because the language is aggressive and critical. Disgust might be involved too, but the primary emotion here seems to be frustration, which falls under anger. Fear or surprise aren't present; there's no indication of worry or astonishment. Joy and sadness are also not applicable.

So, the main emotion conveyed is anger.

Okay, so the user has given me this query where they want to classify a tweet based on emotion from a predefined list. Let's see... The tweet is about people worrying about Avengers Endgame spoilers but not caring about Game of Thrones spoilers. The author is frustrated because he knows everyone watched both.

First, I need to understand what emotion the author is expressing. The words "fucks sake" and "hypocrites" show anger or frustration. He's upset that people are more concerned with one movie than another.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger includes annoyance and rage, which fits here. Disgust might be if he was disliking something, but it doesn't seem to be the case. Fear isn't present; there's no anxiety or terror. Joy? Definitely not. Sadness could come into play with disappointment, but the primary emotion is more frustration.

Surprise is about being amazed, which isn't happening here. So, anger makes the most sense because of the strong language and criticism directed at others.
