Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion is conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The tweet says, "Hands down the best bit of tv I’ve ever watched #GameofThrones." Alright, let's break this down.

First, the user is expressing their opinion about a TV show. They're using strong language: "hands down" and "best bit of tv I’ve ever watched." These phrases indicate that they have a very positive feeling towards it. 

Now, looking at the emotion categories provided: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet doesn't express any negative emotions like anger or disgust. It's not about fear either; there’s no indication of anxiety or terror. Sadness is also out of the question since they're talking about something positive.

That leaves us with joy and surprise. Joy is associated with happiness, serenity, and ecstasy, which seems to fit here because the user is expressing extreme satisfaction. Surprise is more about being amazed or distracted, but in this case, it's more about a strong positive feeling rather than being surprised per se.

So, considering all that, I think joy is the most relevant emotion here.

Okay, let's try to figure out what emotion is in this tweet: "Hands down the best bit of tv I've ever watched #GameofThrones". So first, I need to understand the content. The user is saying that Game of Thrones was the best TV they've ever watched. They're using superlatives like "hands down" and "best bit", which are strong positive words.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Now, the tweet isn't expressing any negative emotions like anger or disgust. There's no indication of fear or anxiety. Sadness isn't here either because they're talking about enjoyment. Surprise could be a possibility if it's unexpected, but in this case, the user is clearly excited and positive.

So, joy makes the most sense because they're expressing extreme satisfaction and happiness. They're using enthusiastic language to highlight how great Game of Thrones was for them. There's no hint of any other emotion; it's purely a positive sentiment. Therefore, I'm confident that the emotion here is joy.

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion is being conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user wrote: "Hands down the best bit of tv I’ve ever watched #GameofThrones." 

First, let's break down the sentence. "Hands down" is an expression that means something is superior or the best without any doubt. Then they say it's the "best bit of tv," which clearly indicates high praise. The use of superlatives like "ever watched" emphasizes their enthusiasm.

Now, looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to pick the most relevant one from these.

The tweet is expressing strong positive feelings towards Game of Thrones. They're highlighting it as the best TV they've ever seen, which conveys a sense of excitement and happiness. So that points towards "joy." 

I don't think it's surprise because there's no indication of unexpectedness or astonishment beyond the enthusiasm. Sadness isn't applicable here since the sentiment is positive. Fear, anger, and disgust are all negative emotions, so they're out.

Therefore, the emotion conveyed is joy.
