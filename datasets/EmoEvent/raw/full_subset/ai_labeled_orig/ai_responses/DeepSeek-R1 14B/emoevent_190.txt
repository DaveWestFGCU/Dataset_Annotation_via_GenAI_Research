Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion the author of this tweet intended to convey. Let me start by reading the tweet carefully: "FACT #Venezuela Coup is the 1st military operation The DEEPSTATE and TRUMP have worked on Together WELL DONE GUYS USER USER". 

First, the hashtags used are important here. "#Venezuela" obviously relates to the country in question, and "Coup" suggests a reference to political unrest or a potential coup d'état. The mention of "DEEPSTATE" and "TRUMP" indicates that the author is implying some level of conspiracy or collaboration between external forces (possibly referring to the U.S. government) and internal actors in Venezuela.

The phrase "WELL DONE GUYS USER USER" seems like praise directed towards those involved, especially using all caps which often conveys emphasis or excitement. The repetition of "USER" might be a typo or an attempt to emphasize support for others involved in the situation.

Looking at the emotions provided: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to pick one that best fits the sentiment here.

The tweet is expressing approval and commendation ("WELL DONE GUYS") towards what's being referred to as a coup operation involving external forces. This suggests positive reinforcement rather than negative emotions like anger or disgust. The tone seems supportive and approving, which aligns with joy or serenity. However, given the context of a coup attempt, it's not necessarily ecstatic but more about approval and support.

Considering that the author is praising actions taken by certain groups (DEEPSTATE, TRUMP), they are likely feeling positive about the situation. "Joy" seems to fit here because the author is expressing satisfaction or approval towards the events described.

I don't think it's surprise because there's no indication of unexpectedness; instead, it's more about agreement and support. Fear isn't present as the tweet doesn't convey worry or dread. Disgust would be if they were opposing the actions, but here they're supporting them, so that's not it.

Therefore, the emotion intended is joy.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet into one of the given emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let's start by reading the tweet carefully.

The tweet says: "FACT #Venezuela Coup is the 1st military operation The DEEPSTATE and TRUMP have worked on Together WELL DONE GUYS USER USER". 

First, I notice that the user is using capital letters for certain words like FACT, Coup, DEEPSTATE, and TRUMP. This usually indicates emphasis or strong feelings. Words like "coup" suggest something dramatic or intense happening in Venezuela.

The mention of a military operation involving the "DEEPSTATE" and Trump implies conspiracy theories, which often carry negative connotations. The user is expressing approval with phrases like "WELL DONE GUYS," which are positive. However, given the context of a coup and involvement by these entities, it's more about supporting something controversial rather than pure joy.

Looking at the emotion categories:

- Anger: The tweet doesn't explicitly express anger but does show strong support for actions that might be seen negatively.
- Disgust: This could relate to disapproval, but here the user is approving of the coup.
- Fear: There's no indication of fear in the message.
- Joy: While "WELL DONE" is positive, it's more aligned with supporting a political action rather than pure happiness.
- Sadness: Not present here.
- Surprise: The content doesn't seem surprising; instead, it's more about asserting facts.

The strong approval suggests joy, but given the context of a coup and conspiracy, it might lean towards another emotion. However, since "joy" is one of the categories and the user is celebrating the action, that's the closest fit. Alternatively, it could be seen as anger towards the situation, but the tone seems more celebratory.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The phrase "WELL DONE GUYS" is clearly positive and enthusiastic, which aligns with joy. Even though the subject matter is serious, the emotion conveyed by the user's language is approval and satisfaction.

Alright, I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion conveyed. Let's see what the tweet says: "FACT #Venezuela Coup is the 1st military operation The DEEPSTATE and TRUMP have worked on Together WELL DONE GUYS USER USER". 

First, the hashtag #Venezuela suggests it's related to the political situation there. The mention of a "coup" indicates some instability or conflict. Words like "FACT" and "WELL DONE" seem positive, almost celebratory. The user is praising the action, using emojis with stars (✨) which usually express joy or approval.

The author refers to the "DEEPSTATE" and TRUMP working together, implying a successful operation. The exclamation marks and enthusiastic language like "GUYS" add to the celebratory tone. There's no negative language here; instead, it's more about applauding the action.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger isn't present because there's no frustration or irritation. Disgust is also absent since the author seems supportive. Fear and surprise aren't indicated either. Sadness doesn't fit the context. The predominant emotion is joy, as the tweet expresses satisfaction and approval of the coup.
