Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion the author of this tweet is conveying regarding the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The tweet says that there's a brief glimmer of hope because the main three 13-century stained glass windows may have survived. It also mentions that Culture Minister Franck Riester stated they don't appear to have suffered catastrophic damage.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to pick the most relevant one based on what's expressed in the tweet.

The author starts with "a brief glimmer of hope," which immediately makes me think of positivity or optimism. Then they mention that all three windows seem saved and quote the minister saying there's no catastrophic damage. This seems like good news amidst a tragic event, so it's likely a positive emotion.

Now, let's consider each category. Anger doesn't fit because there's nothing negative or confrontational here. Disgust also isn't applicable; the tone is hopeful, not disgusted. Fear? No, they're talking about something surviving, which is reassuring rather than fearful. Joy seems right—hope and positive news usually align with joy.

Sadness is possible because the fire was a tragedy, but the tweet focuses on the survival of the windows, highlighting a positive outcome. Surprise could be considered since it's unexpected that the windows survived, but the main emotion here is more about hope and positivity rather than being surprised.

So I think the most relevant emotion here is joy because the author is expressing hope and good news despite the tragedy.

Alright, let's break this down. The user wants me to classify a tweet based on the emotion it conveys, choosing from anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

The tweet talks about Notre-Dame Cathedral's fire but focuses on the survival of the stained glass windows. It mentions a "glimmer of hope" and that they were saved. The author seems relieved and positive.

Looking at the options: joy is about happiness or serenity. Sadness would be if it was about loss, which isn't the case here. Fear or surprise don't fit either because there's no indication of worry or astonishment beyond the news itself.

So, the emotion here is definitely joy because the tweet brings a positive note amidst tragedy.
