Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion behind it. The user wrote, "Such a masterpiece of a free kick. That is what Messi is made of." These sentences are clearly expressing admiration and appreciation for Messi's skill in a free kick. Words like "masterpiece" and "what Messi is made of" indicate awe and respect.

Looking further, the hashtags include #messi messing with USER, which might be a typo or playful tweak but doesn't change the overall positive sentiment. The other hashtags are related to football clubs and competitions, showing excitement about the game.

Considering the emotion categories: anger isn't present here; the tone is positive. Disgust or disinterest? No, it's quite the opposite. Fear or anxiety? Not at all. Sadness or pensiveness? Nope, it's upbeat. That leaves surprise or joy. While surprising might fit if the free kick was unexpected, the overall tone leans more towards admiration and happiness.

So, the emotion is **joy** because the user is expressing praise and delight about Messi's performance.

Alright, let me break down this thought process step by step.

First, I look at the tweet: "Such a masterpiece of a free kick. That is what Messi is made of. #messi messing with USER. #BarcaLiverpool #ChampionsLeague #BarçaLFC #BarcelonaLiverpool". 

The user starts by praising Messi's free kick as a "masterpiece", which immediately conveys admiration and appreciation—positive emotions. The phrase "that is what Messi is made of" reinforces this by highlighting Messi's skills and qualities.

Next, the hashtags used are all related to soccer clubs and competitions like #ChampionsLeague, which adds context that the tweet is about a game or event involving these teams. However, there's a slight twist with "#messi messing with USER"—this part could be interpreted in two ways: either playfully messing around or causing frustration. But given the overall tone of admiration towards Messi, it seems more playful than annoyed.

Considering the emotion categories provided—anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise—the tweet doesn't show any signs of anger, disgust, fear, or sadness. There's no indication of surprise either; instead, the language used is celebratory and appreciative.

Therefore, the dominant emotion here is joy. The user is expressing pleasure and pride in Messi's performance, which falls under the joy category.

Okay, let's try to figure out the emotion behind this tweet. The user wrote, "Such a masterpiece of a free kick. That is what Messi is made of." Hmm, that sounds really positive. They're praising Messi's skill with words like "masterpiece" and "made of," which shows admiration.

Then they mention hashtags like #messi messing with USER, but I think that's just part of the username reference or maybe a typo. The other hashtags are about Barca, Liverpool, Champions League, etc., so probably related to a football match they're excited about.

The overall tone is definitely celebratory and full of praise for Messi. They seem happy about his performance. So looking at the emotion list, joy seems to fit here because it's about expressing positive feelings and admiration.
