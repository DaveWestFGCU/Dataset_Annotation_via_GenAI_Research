Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion the author is conveying. The tweet says: "What an atmosphere last night. It’s a shame the players didn’t use it. We were the 12th man last night. #COYS #ChampionsLeague https://t.co/LzXXsYklDJ"

First, I notice that the user starts with a positive statement about the atmosphere being great. They mention "What an atmosphere," which suggests they're happy or impressed by the environment.

Next, they express disappointment by saying it's a shame the players didn't use that atmosphere. This part shows some negative emotion—probably frustration or letdown because they wanted the team to perform better with such support.

Then, they refer to themselves as the "12th man." In football terms, this is a common expression where fans feel like an extra player on the field, providing additional support and motivation. The mention of being the 12th man reinforces their pride and positivity about their role in the game.

The hashtags "#COYS" (which stands for "Come On You Spartans," a motivational phrase) and "#ChampionsLeague" further emphasize their enthusiasm and support for their team in the competition.

Putting it all together, the initial positive sentiment about the atmosphere and the pride in being the 12th man suggests joy. The disappointment about the players' performance doesn't outweigh the overall positive feelings expressed throughout the tweet.

The author is expressing a mix of positive emotions and mild disappointment. The use of "What an atmosphere" indicates excitement, while the mention of feeling like the 12th man shows pride and support. Despite the mild criticism of the players not utilizing the atmosphere, the overall tone leans more towards positivity and enthusiasm.

**joy**

Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion behind it. The user is talking about an atmosphere last night and mentions that they were the "12th man," which I know refers to a large group of supporters, like in sports where fans act as the 12th player on the team.

The tweet starts with "What an atmosphere last night." That sounds positive, indicating excitement or joy. The next part says, "It’s a shame the players didn’t use it," which shows some disappointment because the players didn't take advantage of the supportive environment.

So combining these elements: excitement about the atmosphere but disappointment in how the players responded. However, the overall tone isn't negative; it's more about expressing support and hoping for better performance next time. The hashtags #COYS (which I think stands for "Come On You S**s," a common cheer) and #ChampionsLeague also reinforce that this is a supportive and enthusiastic message.

Looking at the emotion categories, joy fits here because they're highlighting a positive experience despite some disappointment. They were supportive, which aligns with joy.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out the emotion in this tweet about the UEFA Champions League. The user wrote: "What an atmosphere last night. It’s a shame the players didn’t use it. We were the 12th man last night. #COYS #ChampionsLeague https://t.co/LzXXsYklDJ"

First, I notice the words "What an atmosphere" which suggests that the environment was electric or exciting. That usually brings positive feelings. The mention of being the "12th man" refers to a large and supportive fanbase, which is often seen as a positive thing in sports.

However, the user then says it's a "shame" that the players didn't use the atmosphere. "Shame" implies disappointment or sadness because things didn't go as expected. So there's a contrast here between the positive vibe of the event and the negative outcome due to the players' performance.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The word "shame" points towards sadness. The user is expressing disappointment because despite having great support, the team didn't perform well, which leads to a feeling of letdown or sorrow.

I don't think it's anger because there's no direct expression of frustration or rage. It's more about the outcome being worse than expected. Disgust isn't really here; it's not about hating something but rather being disheartened. Fear and surprise aren't present either. Joy is for positive emotions, which the user starts with but ends on a negative note.

So, considering all that, the emotion conveyed is sadness because of the unmet expectations and disappointment in the players' performance despite a supportive atmosphere.
