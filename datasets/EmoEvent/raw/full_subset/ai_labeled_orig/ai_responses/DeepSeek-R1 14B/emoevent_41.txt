Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this tweet's emotion. The tweet says, "I LOVE BOOKS!!!!!!!! #WorldBookDay #Reading Currently reading a good book, oh yeah." So, first off, I notice the user is using all caps and multiple exclamation points, which usually indicates strong positive feelings.

They mention loving books and are currently reading one. Words like "LOVE" and "good book" definitely show affection and happiness. The hashtags also relate to a celebration of reading, which is a joyful event. There's no indication of any negative emotions or conflicts here. 

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Joy fits because they're expressing love and enthusiasm about books. I don't see any elements pointing towards other emotions like surprise or fear. They're clearly happy and excited about reading.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a tweet and wants it classified into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully: "I LOVE BOOKS!!!!!!!! #WorldBookDay #Reading Currently reading a good book, oh yeah." 

The words "LOVE" and "good book" stand out. The use of all caps and multiple exclamation points indicates strong positive emotion. The hashtags also suggest excitement about reading.

Looking at the options, joy fits because the author expresses love and enthusiasm. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or sadness. Fear or surprise aren't present either. Disgust is out of the question given the positive tone.

So, I'm confident that the emotion here is joy.
