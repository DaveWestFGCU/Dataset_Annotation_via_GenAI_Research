Okay, so I need to classify this tweet into one of the given emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me look at the tweet carefully.

The tweet says: "Also why not save the whole cathedral with a miracle rather than just the cross?. ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”mmmmm~!. #NotreDameCathedral #Notre_dame_de_Paris #NotreDame #NotreDameCathedralFire https://t.co/8OGQ21BoWV"

First, I notice that the user is expressing disappointment or frustration. They're questioning why only part of the cathedral was saved (the cross) and not the whole structure. The repeated use of "ðŸ¤”" suggests confusion or maybe disbelief.

The mention of a miracle implies they might have expected divine intervention to save the entire cathedral, which didn't happen. So, the feeling isn't pure surprise; it's more about being let down or frustrated.

Looking at the emotion categories:

- Anger: Could be frustration.
- Disgust: Doesn't seem relevant here.
- Fear: Not applicable.
- Joy: Definitely not.
- Sadness: Fits because of disappointment and grief over the loss.
- Surprise: There's an element, but it's more about being upset that the full structure wasn't saved.

So, the main emotion is sadness due to the disappointing outcome and the sense of loss from the fire. The repeated thinking emojis and the questioning tone support this.

Okay, I need to classify this tweet's emotion. Let me look at the content first.

The user is asking why a miracle didn't save the whole cathedral, just the cross. They're expressing doubt or confusion with multiple thinking emojis and a dragged-out sound "mmmmm~". The hashtags are about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire.

So, the main feeling here seems to be surprise mixed with maybe some confusion. They're reacting to an unexpected event and questioning why things happened that way. There's no strong anger or sadness in the words used; it's more about being amazed or puzzled.

**surprise**

Okay, so I have this tweet to classify into one of the given emotion categories. Let me read it carefully: "Also why not save the whole cathedral with a miracle rather than just the cross?. ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”mmmmm~!. #NotreDameCathedral #Notre_dame_de_Paris #NotreDame #NotreDameCathedralFire https://t.co/8OGQ21BoWV"

Hmm, first I should understand what the tweet is saying. The user is talking about Notre-Dame Cathedral, which was destroyed by a fire in 2019. They're expressing some frustration or disappointment because they mention saving "the whole cathedral" instead of just the cross. The repeated "ðŸ¤”" emojis and the "mmmmm~!" sound like they're confused or upset.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to pick one that best fits.

The user seems annoyed or frustrated because they expected a miracle to save the whole cathedral but it didn't happenâ€”only the cross was saved? Or maybe that's not accurate; perhaps only the cross remained. So they're disappointed or upset about that outcome.

Wait, "why not save the whole cathedral with a miracle rather than just the cross" suggests they are upset because their expectation wasn't metâ€”they wanted more than just the cross to be saved. This might indicate anger or maybe surprise? But the frustration and disappointment lean more towards anger.

Alternatively, could it be sadness? They're sad about the loss of the cathedral. But I think the primary emotion here is more about being annoyed that only a part was saved, which points to anger.

The emojis used are thinking faces, which might indicate surprise or confusion, but combined with the wording, I think the main emotion is frustration, which falls under anger.
