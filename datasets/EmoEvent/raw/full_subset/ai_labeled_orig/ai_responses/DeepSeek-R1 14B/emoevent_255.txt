Okay, so I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion it conveys. The tweet says, "Happy #WorldBookDay! We invite you to use our collection of books, journals and media ðŸ“š To search ARCH's online Library Catalogue, go to https://t.co/chw28NC0a4 https://t.co/u9qyG3IoC2". 

First, I notice the tweet starts with "Happy #WorldBookDay!", which immediately signals a positive emotion. The use of emojis like ðŸ“š also adds to that cheerful tone. They're inviting people to use their collection and providing links, which shows enthusiasm and excitement about promoting reading.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Since the tweet is celebrating World Book Day and encouraging others to engage with books, the primary emotion here seems to be joy. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or disgust. It doesn't evoke fear or surprise either; it's more about sharing a positive message.

I think "joy" fits best because they're expressing happiness and eagerness to share resources related to reading.
