Okay, so I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion it conveys. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me look at the tweet again: "Billionaires pledging tons of money to fix a church whilst they can easily donate funds to 'things' that truly matter." It's talking about billionaires donating to repair Notre-Dame Cathedral but implies they should be supporting more important causes.

The author seems critical here. They're pointing out a contrast between what the billionaires are doing and what they could be doing instead. The use of words like "whilst" and "easily donate funds to 'things' that truly matter" suggests a sense of frustration or disapproval. This feels more like anger because it's about people not prioritizing correctly, which can evoke irritation or resentment.

I don't think it's disgust because the tweet isn't expressing a strong aversion to something but rather a critique of priorities. Fear and surprise are also not present; there's no indication of worry or astonishment here. Sadness could be a possibility if it were about the tragedy itself, but the focus is more on the action of donating versus what they should do. So yeah, I think anger is the most fitting emotion here.

Okay, I need to classify the emotion in this tweet related to the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Looking at the tweet: "Billionaires pledging tons of money to fix a church whilst they can easily donate funds to 'things' that truly matter." The author is pointing out that wealthy individuals are donating to a cathedral while possibly neglecting more important causes. 

The tone here seems critical and disapproving. They're suggesting that the priorities of the billionaires aren't aligned with what's really important, which makes me think they're expressing disgust or maybe anger.

But wait, the tweet doesn't explicitly show anger but rather points out a contrast in priorities. Disgust often involves feelings of dislike or disapproval, so this fits better than anger because it's more about disapproving of the situation rather than being enraged.

So I'm leaning towards disgust as the emotion.

**disgust**

Alright, let's break this down step by step. I've got a tweet about the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire, and I need to figure out what emotion the author is conveying from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

First, reading the tweet: "Billionaires pledging tons of money to fix a church whilst they can easily donate funds to 'things' that truly matter. #NotreDameCathedralFire #NotreDame https://t.co/JCgtECYWJQ"

The author is pointing out that billionaires are donating a lot to rebuild the cathedral but suggests that there are other causes (referred to as "things") that matter more and aren't being funded. The use of quotes around "things" implies skepticism or maybe criticism about what's considered important.

I need to figure out the emotion here. Let's go through each category:

- **Anger**: This seems possible because the author is criticizing the billionaires' priorities, which could stem from frustration or anger.
- **Disgust**: Maybe, as they might feel disgust towards the situation or the priorities of the donors.
- **Fear**: Doesn't seem to fit here; there's no indication of fear in the tweet.
- **Joy/Serenity**: Definitely not; the tone is negative.
- **Sadness/Grief**: The author could be expressing sadness about the fire, but the main focus is on the funding issue, so maybe not the primary emotion.
- **Surprise**: Not really, unless it's surprising that money is going to a church, but the tweet seems more critical than surprised.

Between anger and disgust: The tweet expresses frustration with the priorities of the wealthy, which leans towards anger rather than pure disgust. Anger often involves criticism or irritation, which fits here because the author is questioning why funds aren't directed elsewhere.

So, putting it all together, I think the emotion conveyed is **anger**.
</think>

The author's tweet criticizes the allocation of funds by billionaires, expressing frustration and irritation with their priorities. This aligns most closely with anger.

**Answer:**  
**anger**
