Alright, let's try to figure out what emotion is behind this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user says, "Thats #Gameofthrones over for me. They killed the only guy i liked in the show. ðŸ‘Ž"

First, I notice they're expressing that the series is over for them, which suggests they won't be watching anymore. The main point here is the death of their favorite character. When someone dies on a show, especially a beloved one, it usually evokes strong emotions.

Looking at the possible emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. So, did they feel angry? Maybe, but the tweet doesn't express frustration or rage directly. They're more focused on the loss of their character.

Disgust doesn't seem right because that's about dislike or aversion, and the user isn't expressing dislike towards the show itselfâ€”just sad about a character's death.

Fear is about anxiety or terror; there's no indication of fear here. Joy? No, they're clearly not happy. Sadness fits because they lost someone they liked. Theyâ€™re mourning the loss, which falls under sadness.

Surprise is another option, but it's more about unexpected events. While a character death can be surprising, the user seems to acknowledge and accept it, so it's more about the emotional impact rather than surprise.

So putting it all together, the emotion here is sadness because of the loss they experienced.

Alright, let's figure out the emotion behind this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user starts by saying it's over for them because they killed the only guy they liked. That sounds really sad. They're expressing disappointment and loss. The use of a thumbs up emoji is interestingâ€”maybe it's sarcastic or a way to show approval of their own feeling, but not happiness. So, sadness fits best here because they're mourning the character's death.

Alright, let's tackle this tweet classification task step by step. The user wants to determine which emotion is conveyed in the given tweet. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully: "Thats #Gameofthrones over for me. They killed the only guy i liked in the show. ðŸ‘Ž". The user mentions that they're done with Game of Thrones because their favorite character was killed. This immediately makes me think of negative emotions since the outcome is something disappointing.

Breaking it down, the phrase "They killed the only guy I liked" shows disappointment and frustration. When a beloved character dies in a show, fans often feel upset or angry because it can ruin their experience of the series. The use of "over for me" suggests that the user feels let down and is ending their engagement with the show, which reinforces negative feelings.

The reaction emoji used here is a ðŸ‘Ž, which usually signifies approval or a thumbs-up. However, in this context, it might be sarcastic or used to express a strong negative emotionâ€”like disappointment turned into something more intense. It's possible that the user is expressing frustration (anger) because their favorite character was killed, which they perceive as a bad decision by the showrunners.

Considering the emotion categories, anger fits here because the user is clearly upset about the character's death. While sadness could also be applicable since it's about losing someone liked, the strong reaction and possible frustration lean more towards anger.

I don't think disgust applies because there's no indication of dislike or aversion towards something specific. Fear isn't present as there's no threat or anxiety mentioned. Joy is out of the question given the negative context. Surprise might come into play if it were an unexpected event, but since the user refers to their favorite character being killed, which could have been anticipated, surprise doesn't fit.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed here is primarily anger due to the frustration and disappointment expressed about the character's death.
