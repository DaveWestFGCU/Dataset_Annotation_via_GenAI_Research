Alright, so I need to figure out what emotion the author of this tweet is conveying. The tweet says: "#GameofThrones is my forever obsession & guilty pleasure!! ❤️❤️❤️". 

First, let's break down the words and emojis used. They mention it's their "forever obsession" and a "guilty pleasure," which are both positive terms even though "guilty pleasure" implies they might not want others to know about it. The use of multiple heart eyes emojis (❤️) definitely adds an emotional touch, likely indicating affection or love.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to pick one that best fits. 

The tweet expresses strong positive feelings towards Game of Thrones. They're obsessive about it and enjoy it, even if it's a guilty pleasure. The emojis reinforce this positive sentiment. So, joy seems appropriate because they're expressing love and excitement.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, or surprise here. Sadness doesn't fit either since the tone is upbeat with enthusiasm. Therefore, the emotion conveyed is joy.

Surprise isn't really applicable here because they're expressing a consistent feeling rather than something unexpected.
