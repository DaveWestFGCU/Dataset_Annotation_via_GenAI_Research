Okay, I'm trying to figure out the emotion behind this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user wrote: "#CrownOfThorns of Christ?......Are you kidding me?....How long can thorns last for...3000 years? Then again, what do i really know, just curious. #NotreDameFire #NotreDameCathedralFire #NotreDameCathedral"

First, I notice the mention of "Crown of Thorns" which is a religious symbol. The user seems to be questioning something about it. They start with "Are you kidding me?" which indicates surprise or confusion. Then they ask how long thorns can last for 3000 years and admit they're just curious.

The emotion categories are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. From the tweet, the main feelings expressed seem to be surprise because of the rhetorical questions and disbelief in the longevity mentioned. There's no clear sign of anger or disgust; it's more about being amazed or confused. So I think the emotion here is surprise.

Alright, so I need to figure out the emotion behind this tweet regarding the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire. The user is talking about the "Crown of Thorns" and seems a bit confused or doubtful. They mention being curious but also express skepticism with phrases like "Are you kidding me?" and questioning how long thorns could last for 3000 years.

First, I'll break down the tweet: they start by referencing the Crown of Thorns, which is a significant religious artifact linked to Notre-Dame. Then they question its authenticity or longevity, showing disbelief. They also mention their curiosity but admit uncertainty, which adds to the sense of doubt rather than anger or fear.

Looking at the emotion categories provided: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The user isn't expressing anger or joy; there's no indication of extreme emotions like fear or sadness about the fire itself. Instead, their focus seems to be on questioning something related to the cathedral's artifacts. 

The key here is the use of rhetorical questions and skepticism, which points towards surprise. They're surprised by the idea that thorns could last so long, hence the disbelief. While some might argue it's a bit of disgust or doubt, the primary emotion conveyed seems to be surprise because they're reacting to an unexpected or unbelievable situation.

So, putting it all together, the tweet mainly conveys surprise due to the skeptical and questioning tone regarding the Crown of Thorns.
