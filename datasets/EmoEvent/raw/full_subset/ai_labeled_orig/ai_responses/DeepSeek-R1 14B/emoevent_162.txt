Alright, I need to classify this tweet's emotion from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

The tweet says: "#Venezuela When tyranny becomes law, rebellion is a right. Simon Bolivar"

First, looking at the content. The mention of "tyranny" and "rebellion" suggests opposition to authority or government actions. This implies frustration or不满 with the current situation.

Next, the hashtag is #Venezuela, which relates to the political crisis where there's tension between Maduro and Guaido.

The quote from Simon Bolivar reinforces the idea of fighting against oppressive rule. It's a strong statement supporting rebellion as a right when laws are unjust.

Considering the emotion categories: Anger fits because it reflects frustration or opposition to what the author perceives as tyranny. There's no indication of disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The main sentiment is defiance and opposition, which aligns with anger.

The tweet expresses **anger** due to its strong opposition against tyranny, using a quote that advocates for rebellion. 

**Answer:** **anger**

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The tweet says: "#Venezuela When tyranny becomes law, rebellion is a right. Simon Bolivar". 

Let me break it down. First, the hashtag #Venezuela indicates it's about the situation there. The main message is referencing Simon Bolivar, a historical figure known for his role in South American independence. The quote itself talks about "tyranny" becoming law and that rebellion is a right.

So, what emotion does this convey? Rebellion implies resistance against authority, which often comes from frustration or anger. Using the word "tyranny" suggests strong negative feelings towards the current government. It's not disgust because it doesn't express dislike for someone but rather a political stance. Fear isn't present here; instead, there's a call to action. Joy and surprise don't fit either.

Therefore, the emotion is likely anger, as the tweet is making a strong statement against perceived tyranny.

Okay, I need to classify this tweet's emotion. The tweet says: "#Venezuela When tyranny becomes law, rebellion is a right. Simon Bolivar." 

First, looking at the content, it mentions "tyranny" and "rebellion as a right," which suggests a stance against authority. The mention of Simon Bolivar, a historical Venezuelan leader known for fighting against Spanish rule, adds context about resistance.

The emotions available are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. 

I don't see signs of joy or serenity here. It's more about opposing something rather than expressing positive feelings.

Sadness might come into play if it's about the country's situation, but the tweet seems more about challenging authority rather than mourning.

Surprise isn't really there; it's a statement, not an unexpected event.

Fear? Maybe fear of repression, but again, the tone is more confrontational.

Anger or disgust: "tyranny" implies strong dislike or anger towards those in power. Rebellion suggests resistance, which can stem from anger at oppressive rule. 

So, the emotion here seems to be anger, as it's a call to resist what's seen as tyranny.
