Alright, so I need to classify the emotion of this tweet based on the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Let's break down the tweet step by step.

First, looking at the content: "This story will make your day! ðŸ˜Š Meet USER and share her empowering message for refugees and youth everywhere." The use of a smiley face ðŸ˜Š indicates positivity. Words like "empowering" suggest something uplifting or positive.

The mention of sharing a message for refugees and youth implies that it's intended to inspire or motivate. The hashtags are #WorldBookDay with a book emoji, which ties into promoting reading and positive messages.

Considering the emotion categories, anger is out because there's no sign of irritation or rage. Disgust doesn't fit either; the tweet isn't expressing dislike or disinterest. Fear is unlikely as there's nothing indicating anxiety or apprehension. Sadness is also not present since the tone is positive. Surprise might be a contender due to the smiley, but I think joy fits better because of the empowering message and the celebratory tone related to World Book Day.

So, putting it all together, the author is conveying joy through positivity, inspiration, and celebration.

The tweet expresses **joy** with its positive message and smiley face.

Alright, so I need to figure out the emotion in this tweet. Let's look at the text first. The user wrote, "This story will make your day! ðŸ˜Š Meet USER and share her empowering message for refugees and youth everywhere." They also included some links and hashtags related to World Book Day.

The smiley face emoji ðŸ˜Š is a big clue. Smiling usually indicates happiness or joy. The words "make your day" and "empowering message" are positive and uplifting. There's no negative language here; instead, the tone is encouraging and hopeful.

I should consider each emotion category: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Anger isn't present because there's no frustration or irritation. Disgust doesn't fit either since there's nothing negative being discussed. Fear is absent as well; the message is about empowerment, which is positive. Sadness isn't here because everything seems uplifting.

That leaves us with joy and surprise. The tweet is definitely expressing a positive emotion. While surprise could be an option if something unexpected happened, in this case, it's more about spreading happiness and inspiration. So, joy makes the most sense because the author wants to share something that brings people joy and empowerment.

**joy**

Alright, let me try to figure out the emotion in this tweet. The user is talking about a story that's supposed to make your day, so they mention it with a smiley face ðŸ˜Š. They also highlight an empowering message for refugees and youth everywhere. Words like "empowering" and positive actions like "meet USER and share her..." suggest a positive sentiment.

Looking at the structure, there are no negative words or any signs of distress. The emojis used are smiley and book-related, both pointing towards a happy tone. The hashtags also align with World Book Day, which is all about promoting reading and books in a positive light.

I don't see any elements that would indicate anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise. It's clearly aimed to spread joy and inspiration. So the emotion here must be joy.

**joy**
