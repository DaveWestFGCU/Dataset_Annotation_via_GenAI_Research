Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion this tweet is conveying. The tweet says: "Yes, the people of #Venezuela Reject #DC's selected #Guaido #HandsOffVenezuela". 

First, let me break down the content. It's talking about Venezuela rejecting someone named Guaido who was selected by DC (I think that refers to the Democratic Coalition or maybe an international body). The hashtags used are "#HandsOffVenezuela", which implies a desire for other countries not to interfere.

The emotion here is likely one of opposition or resistance. The author is expressing support for the people of Venezuela in rejecting Guaido, possibly because they see him as someone imposed by external forces. This could be seen as a show of solidarity with Maduro's government against what they perceive as foreign interference.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger might fit if the tweet is expressing frustration or opposition. Disgust could also apply if it's about disliking Guaido or the situation, but I'm not sure that's the main emotion here. Fear doesn't seem relevant, nor does joy or surprise. Sadness isn't really the feeling conveyed either.

So between anger and disgust. The tweet is more about rejecting someone they don't want, which might stem from frustration or anger towards those who support Guaido. Alternatively, it could be a statement of defiance, which also has elements of anger.

I think the primary emotion here is anger because the author is rejecting Guaido and opposing foreign involvement in Venezuela's affairs.

The tweet expresses opposition to Juan Guaido and external interference, conveying frustration and defiance.

**emotion**: **anger**

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet into one of the given emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The tweet is about Venezuela's political crisis, and it says, "Yes, the people of #Venezuela Reject #DC's selected #Guaido #HandsOffVenezuela" with a link.

First, I should figure out what emotion the author is conveying. The tweet mentions that Venezuelans are rejecting someone named Guaido, who was selected by DC (probably an acronym for a political party or group). The hashtag "#HandsOffVenezuela" suggests a call to action against foreign interference.

The word "reject" here is strong and indicates opposition. Since the author is supporting Maduro's legitimacy against Guaido, they might be expressing frustration or anger towards those who support Guaido, like DC. So, the emotion here seems to be anger because of the rejection and the implication that others are interfering or not respecting the people's choice.

I don't think it's disgust because there's no clear indication of dislike towards a person or thing mentioned. Fear is unlikely unless there's a sense of threat, but the tweet doesn't express that. Joy isn't here since they're talking about rejection. Sadness could be possible if expressing grief over the situation, but the strong stance suggests anger more than sadness. Surprise doesn't fit because it's a clear statement rather than something unexpected.

So, putting it all together, the emotion is probably anger.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion the author intended. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me look at the tweet carefully.

The user wrote: "Yes, the people of #Venezuela Reject #DC's selected #Guaido #HandsOffVenezuela". 

Hmm, the hashtag mentions Venezuela rejecting someone named Guaido, who I remember is Juan Guaido, a key figure in the political crisis. The author is saying that the people are rejecting him, so they're showing support against Guaido.

The wording "Reject" is strong and implies opposition or dislike. They're probably expressing dissatisfaction with Guaido's involvement. There's also the hashtag "#HandsOffVenezuela," which suggests a desire to protect their country from external influence, maybe implying frustration with foreign interference.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger includes annoyance and rage, disgust includes dislike and disinterest. The tweet is clearly against Guaido, showing strong opposition. It feels more like anger because of the explicit rejection and the call to action ("HandsOff"), which are confrontational. Disgust might be if they were expressing aversion towards something, but here it's more about opposing someone actively.

So I think the emotion here is **anger**.
