Alright, I need to classify the emotion in this tweet. The user is talking about a beautiful Baobab tree and mentions reasons to respect and take care of the planet. They're using hashtags related to climate action and Greta Thunberg.

Looking at the emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet is highlighting positive actions towards the environment. Words like "beautiful" and "respect" suggest a positive sentiment. The hashtags are about taking action, which indicates proactive feelings rather than negative ones.

So, the emotion here is likely joy because it's about appreciating nature and encouraging positive climate actions.

**joy**

Alright, so I need to figure out the emotion behind this tweet. The user mentions Primavera along with redwoods and a baobab tree. Theyâ€™re talking about respecting the planet because of these beautiful trees. The hashtags include ClimateBreakdown, ClimateEmergency, ClimateAction, climatestrike, and GretaThunberg.

Hmm, the overall tone seems positive but with urgency. They're highlighting the importance of taking care of the environment. I don't see any negative words here; it's more about appreciation and a call to action. The emotions given are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. 

Respect for nature usually conveys joy or serenity, but since they're mentioning climate issues, maybe there's an underlying sense of urgency. However, the primary emotion is likely positive because they're emphasizing the beauty and importance, encouraging action rather than expressing distress.

So I think it's **joy**, as it aligns with appreciation and a call to protect the planet in a hopeful way.
