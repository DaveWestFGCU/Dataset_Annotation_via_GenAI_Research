Alright, let's break down this query step by step. The user wants me to classify a tweet based on the emotion conveyed, choosing from anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll look at the tweet: "Feeding the military industrial complex and feeding war is not the answer for #Venezuela. Attention needs to be paid to Saudi Arabia and their terrorism around the globe." 

The user mentions feeding the military-industrial complex and war as negative actions, implying they're upset about policies that might be increasing conflict or diverting attention from Venezuela's issues. The mention of Saudi Arabia and terrorism adds a layer of concern about broader global instability.

Now, considering the emotion categories: anger is about irritation or hostility; disgust is more about disapproval or aversion; fear involves apprehension; joy is positive emotions; sadness relates to grief; surprise is about unexpected events.

The tweet expresses frustration with current policies and concern over external actions (Saudi Arabia). This seems more like a strong disapproval rather than outright anger. The user isn't yelling but is clearly against these actions, which points towards disgust because they're expressing aversion towards the policies mentioned.

I don't think it's fear because there's no direct indication of personal threat or anxiety. Sadness might be if it was about the situation itself, but here it's more about disapproving of others' actions.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

Looking at the tweet: "Feeding the military industrial complex and feeding war is not the answer for #Venezuela. Attention needs to be paid to Saudi Arabia and their terrorism around the globe."

The user is talking about Venezuela's situation but then shifts focus to Saudi Arabia and terrorism. The words used like "feeding the military industrial complex" and "war" suggest frustration or disapproval with current policies or actions.

They express that this approach isn't working for Venezuela, which could indicate disappointment. Then they bring up Saudi Arabia's role in terrorism, showing strong disapproval or disgust towards their actions globally.

The emotion seems to be more about disapproval and dislike rather than anger or fear. So the primary emotion here is disgust.

**disgust**

Alright, I need to figure out which emotion the author of this tweet is conveying. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Looking at the tweet: "Feeding the military industrial complex and feeding war is not the answer for #Venezuela. Attention needs to be paid to Saudi Arabia and their terrorism around the globe."

The first part mentions feeding the military-industrial complex and war as not being solutions for Venezuela. That sounds like criticism or frustration towards policies or actions related to military spending or involvement, which could indicate anger.

The second part talks about Saudi Arabia's terrorism globally. The use of strong words like "terrorism" and the overall tone suggests disapproval and possibly disgust at the actions being taken by certain countries or entities.

So, the author seems to be expressing both frustration (anger) and disapproval (disgust). But I need to pick the most relevant emotion from the given list. Between anger and disgust, which one fits better?

The tweet is more about denouncing specific actions rather than expressing personal dislike. However, "terrorism" is a strong term that could evoke disgust or horror.

Wait, but the primary focus is on the Venezuelan situation and Saudi Arabia's role. The author is pointing out issues with how Venezuela is being handled and criticising Saudi Arabia for terrorism. This could be seen as frustration towards those in power or those involved (anger) rather than a disgusted reaction to an action itself.

Alternatively, when talking about terrorism, it's more of a negative judgment, which might lean towards disgust. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the overall tone is more critical and angry towards the approach taken by others regarding Venezuela and Saudi Arabia.

I think anger fits better because the author is expressing frustration with the policies or actions related to the crisis, rather than a disgusted reaction to something恶心的 (disgusting).
