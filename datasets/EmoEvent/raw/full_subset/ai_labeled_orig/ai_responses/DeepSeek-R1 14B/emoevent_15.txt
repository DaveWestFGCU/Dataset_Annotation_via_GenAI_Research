Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a tweet about the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire and wants it classified into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says, "#NotreDameCathedralFire the people that are saying that Notre Dame is “just a building”, are heartless. i pray you realize the bigger picture here."

The author is addressing those who dismiss the cathedral as just a building. They're calling them "heartless," which clearly conveys disapproval or disappointment. The use of "pray" suggests they're hoping others see beyond the structure to its cultural and historical significance, indicating a strong emotional response.

Now, looking at the emotion categories: anger involves annoyance or rage. Disgust includes dislike or disinterest. Fear relates to anxiety or terror. Sadness is about grief or pensiveness. Surprise is for amazement or distraction.

The tweet isn't expressing fear or surprise. There's no indication of joy either. The author isn't happy; instead, they're upset with others' attitudes. They're frustrated and disappointed, which fits more under sadness rather than anger because it's a deep-seated disappointment about people's lack of empathy.

So, the emotion here is sadness because the author feels sorrowful about how some view the situation, not just angry or disgusted.

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion the author of this tweet is conveying. The tweet says: "#NotreDameCathedralFire the people that are saying that Notre Dame is 'just a building', are heartless. i pray you realize the bigger picture here."

First, let's break down the content. The author is addressing people who dismiss the cathedral as just a building. They're calling those people heartless, which clearly shows some negative emotion towards those individuals' viewpoint.

The mention of praying for others to see the bigger picture suggests that the author feels strongly about the significance of Notre Dame beyond its physical structure. This could be related to cultural, historical, or emotional value.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet doesn't express fear or anxiety, so probably not fear. There's no indication of joy or serenity, so those are out. Sadness is a possibility because they're talking about loss and perhaps mourning something important, but I also see elements of frustration.

The author isn't just sad; they're expressing frustration towards others' insensitive remarks. That leans more into anger. They're upset with people who don't understand the deeper meaning of the fire's impact on Notre Dame.

So, considering all this, the emotion here is likely anger because of the strong disapproval and frustration directed at those minimizing the event.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to classify a specific tweet regarding the Notre Dame Cathedral fire into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says, "#NotreDameCathedralFire the people that are saying that Notre Dame is “just a building”, are heartless. i pray you realize the bigger picture here." 

The author is addressing people who claim the cathedral is just a building and calls them heartless. They also mention praying that these individuals understand a larger context.

Breaking this down, the tweet expresses disapproval towards those minimizing the significance of the fire. The word "heartless" indicates strong negative feelings. Additionally, the appeal to recognize a bigger picture suggests frustration or disappointment.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger fits here because the author is expressing irritation and disapproval. Disgust might also be considered since they find the statements heartless, but the primary emotion seems to be directed more towards anger rather than disgust.

The other emotions don't quite fit—fear isn't present, nor is joy or surprise. Sadness could be a component, but the tweet is more about rebuking others' attitudes rather than expressing personal grief.

So, I conclude that the emotion conveyed here is **anger**.
