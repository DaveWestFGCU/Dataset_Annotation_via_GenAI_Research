Record: "Just as the case was with #Syria, Western news outlets refuse to cover the massive rallies launched by the people of #Venezuela today against the latest US-backed military coup attempt because it doesnâ€™t advance their pro-war, regime change agenda. #HandsOffVenezuela https://t.co/TpEMGW1069"

Alright, so I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion the author intended to convey. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Looking at the tweet, it's talking about Western news outlets not covering Venezuelan rallies against a US-backed coup. The author is pointing out what they see as media bias and possibly manipulation. Words like "refuse" and "latest US-backed military coup attempt" indicate frustration and opposition to the situation.

The tone seems critical and disapproving of the media's actions, which could be interpreted as anger because it's a strong reaction against perceived injustices or outrages. The mention of a "pro-war, regime change agenda" suggests the author is upset about what they see as manipulative motives behind the news coverage.

I don't think it's disgust, which is more about feeling something is repulsive. Fear would imply anxiety, but here the focus is on the media's inaction rather than fear of a threat. Joy and surprise are clearly not applicable here since the sentiment isn't positive or surprising. Sadness could be a possibility if it were expressing grief, but the stronger emotion here seems to be anger.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed is likely anger.

Alright, I'm looking at this tweet about Venezuela's situation. The user is talking about how Western news outlets aren't covering the rallies in Venezuela against a US-backed coup attempt. They compare it to Syria and mention the hashtag #HandsOffVenezuela.

Hmm, what emotion is this? Let me break it down. The author seems upset that media isn't reporting on something they consider important. They might feel frustrated or annoyed because their viewpoint isn't getting attention. Using words like "refuse" shows a strong negative feeling.

Is it anger? Yeah, frustration and annoyance fall under anger. There's no clear sign of disgust or fear here. The tone is more about the injustice of the situation rather than being scared or surprised.
