Alright, I need to classify this tweet's emotion. The user is talking about being only on season 1 of Game of Thrones and questioning why others call Arya Stark a Mary Sue. They seem surprised because they're early in the series and might not have seen her character develop yet, leading them to be amazed or distracted by such claims.

The tweet expresses **surprise** as the author is questioning something unexpected about a character they are just starting to get to know.

Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion behind this tweet about Game of Thrones. Let's start by reading it carefully.

The tweet says: "I'm only on season 1 of #GameofThrones but are people seriously calling #AryaStark a Mary Sue?! https://t.co/hvx7sROTKS"

Alright, the person is talking about being only on season 1. So they're not too far into the series. They express surprise or confusion that others are calling Arya Stark a Mary Sue.

Mary Sue is a term used in fan fiction to describe a character who's overly perfect, with no real flaws. It's often used negatively, implying the character is unrealistic and the story bends over backwards to make her look good.

So, the author is questioning why people would label Arya as such. The use of "seriously" adds emphasis, suggesting they find this viewpoint surprising or perhaps a bit extreme.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. 

The author isn't expressing anger or frustration directly; instead, they seem taken aback by others' opinions. They're probably not happy about being called a Mary Sue, but more so surprised that people would make such a claim.

I think the emotion here is surprise because the tweet expresses astonishment or confusion regarding another person's viewpoint.

Alright, so I need to figure out the emotion conveyed in this tweet about Game of Thrones. The user is only on season 1 and is questioning why others are calling Arya Stark a Mary Sue.

First, let's break down the content. They're surprised that people are making such a claim since they're just starting the show. Mary Sue usually refers to a perfect or overly idealized character, which can be seen as criticism. The user's surprise might stem from not having enough context yet to form an opinion themselves.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I don't see signs of anger, as there's no explicit frustration. Disgust isn't really present; they're more questioning than expressing dislike. Fear and sadness aren't indicated either. Joy and serenity also don't fit here.

The key emotion seems to be surprise. The user is amazed that others are making this claim when they haven't seen much of the series yet. They might not understand why someone would label Arya as a Mary Sue without more context, hence their astonishment.
