Okay, so I need to classify the emotion in this tweet: "Anyway, happy #WorldBookDay and protect our libraries.... https://t.co/pPjcUqzvWW". The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. 

First, let's look at the words used. The author starts with "happy", which is a direct indicator of positive emotion. They're celebrating World Book Day, which is about promoting reading and books—something that's generally seen as a good thing.

The tweet also mentions protecting libraries, which is another positive action, supporting literature and access to knowledge. So the overall tone seems upbeat and supportive.

There are no negative words or any signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise. The use of "happy" clearly points towards joy. 

I don't see any elements that would suggest a different emotion. It's a straightforward expression of positivity related to an international book day.
