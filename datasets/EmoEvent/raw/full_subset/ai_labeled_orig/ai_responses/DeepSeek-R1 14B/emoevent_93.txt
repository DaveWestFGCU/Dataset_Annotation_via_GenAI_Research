Alright, I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion conveyed. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Looking at the tweet: it's about German right-wing populists supporting climate change denial and attacking Greta Thunberg by calling her "mentally challenged" and a fraud. That sounds pretty harsh and disrespectful towards Greta. 

The author is likely expressing strong negative feelings towards these actions. They're probably upset or annoyed because they disagree with the AFD's stance on climate change and their treatment of Greta.

So, the emotion here seems to be anger because it's directed at those denying climate change and attacking a young activist.

Okay, I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion the author intended. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet is about Germany's right-wing populists embracing climate change denial to gain support. They're teaming up with scientists who claim that hysteria drives global warming debates and are mocking Greta Thunberg as "mentally challenged" and a fraud.

So, the key points here are the attack on Greta Thunberg and her movement. The author is likely upset about this because they probably support her and the climate cause. Using words like "ridiculing," "fraud," and negative labels towards Greta indicates that the author feels strongly against these actions.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet seems to express strong disapproval or厌恶 towards how Greta is being treated. Disgust can include feelings like dislike or disapproval, so that might fit here. Alternatively, it could be anger because of the harsh words directed at her.

But wait, the author isn't expressing personal fear or sadness; they're reacting to an attack on someone else. The main emotion seems more about disapproving of the treatment towards Greta rather than feeling angry themselves. So, disgust might be the better fit as it captures the dislike for the actions described.

**disgust**

Alright, let me try to figure out which emotion this tweet conveys. The user wants me to classify it using one of the six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It mentions that Germany's right-wing populists (AFD) are embracing climate change denial to gain support. They're teaming up with scientists who claim that hysteria is driving the global warming debate and are mocking Greta Thunberg as "mentally challenged" and a fraud.

Okay, so breaking this down, the tweet is talking about political figures denying climate change for their own gain. That's already concerning because it's about a serious issue being mishandled. Then they're ridiculing Greta Thunberg, who is a prominent figure in the fight against climate change, especially known for her Fridays for Future movement.

The author is pointing out that these groups are not only denying climate change but also attacking an individual who stands against them. This kind of behavior can evoke strong emotions because it's about spreading misinformation and attacking someone's credibility.

Now, considering the emotion categories:

- Anger: The tweet seems to criticize and express disapproval towards AFD and their stance on climate change and Greta Thunberg. This could be seen as frustration or anger towards these groups for their actions.
  
- Disgust: There's a sense of distaste towards the manipulation of science and the personal attack on Greta. Disgust can include feelings of disapproval or aversion, which fits here.

- Fear: I don't see immediate fear-inducing elements, unless it's about the consequences of climate change denial, but that's more about the content rather than the author's emotion.

- Joy/Serenity: Definitely not applicable; the tone is negative.

- Sadness/Pensiveness: While the situation is saddening, the tweet seems more focused on calling out the behavior rather than expressing personal sadness.

- Surprise: The content isn't particularly surprising in the context of political moves, so surprise doesn't seem right.

Between anger and disgust, I think disgust might be a better fit because the author is highlighting the unethical manipulation by AFD and their disrespect towards Greta. Disgust often involves moral judgment and disapproval, which seems to align with the tweet's message.

The tweet conveys **disgust** as it highlights unethical behavior and disrespect towards an environmental advocate.

**disgust**
