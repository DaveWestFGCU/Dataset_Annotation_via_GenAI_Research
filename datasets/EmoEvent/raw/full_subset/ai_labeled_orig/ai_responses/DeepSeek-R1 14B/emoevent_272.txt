Alright, let's tackle this query. The user provided a tweet and wants it classified into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I need to read the tweet carefully. It says, "Simple question: Is it the end of #opera, when artists cannot fly anymore? Sad, would love to see you perform around the world USER. USER #GretaThunberg [link]".

The key words here are "Sad" and "would love". The author is expressing a feeling of loss or longing because they can't see the artist perform globally anymore. They're sad about the situation.

I should consider the context too. The tweet mentions Greta Thunberg, who's known for her climate activism. Maybe the user is connecting environmental issues to the opera scene, but that doesn't change the emotion conveyed.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger isn't present; it's more of a sad sentiment. Disgust or fear don't fit here either. There's no indication of joy or surpriseâ€”just sadness.

Alright, I need to figure out what emotion is conveyed in this tweet about Greta Thunberg and opera. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the tweet: "Simple question: Is it the end of #opera, when artists cannot fly anymore? Sad, would love to see you perform around the world USER. USER #GretaThunberg https://t.co/zrgSCQk6WG"

The user starts with a question about opera and whether it's ending because artists can't fly anymore. They express sadness about wanting to see the artist perform globally.

So, the key emotion here is "sadness." The word "Sad" is explicitly used, indicating that the author feels down or mournful about the situation.

I should make sure not to confuse this with other emotions like anger or surprise. There's no indication of frustration or any element of shock in the tweet. It's a straightforward expression of sorrow for the loss of opera performances.

Therefore, the emotion conveyed is sadness.
