Alright, I need to classify this tweet into one of the given emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me read the tweet carefully.

The tweet starts by quoting Ernest Hemingway about books being loyal friends. That's a positive statement. Then it mentions celebrating World Book Day and encourages developing a positive vision for life. The hashtags are #WorldBookDay and #WorldBookDay2019, both of which are related to promoting reading and books.

The overall tone seems uplifting and encouraging. Words like "celebrate," "positive vision," and the mention of Hemingway's quote all contribute to a sense of joy. There's no indication of any negative emotions or surprise elements. The user is clearly expressing happiness about books and their impact on life.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, or sadness here. Surprise would imply something unexpected, which isn't the case. So, the emotion conveyed is definitely joy.

Alright, I need to figure out which emotion the author intended to convey in this tweet about World Book Day. Let me start by reading the tweet carefully.

The tweet says: "Ernest Hemingway had rightly said, 'There is no friend as loyal as a book'. This #WorldBookDay let's celebrate the power of books and develop a positive vision towards leading our life. #WorldBookDay2019 USER USER"

First, I notice that the author is quoting Ernest Hemingway in a positive light, talking about how loyal books are as friends. They then mention celebrating World Book Day and developing a positive vision for life. The hashtags used are also related to promoting the day.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to pick the most relevant one from these.

The tone of the tweet seems very uplifting and appreciative. They're celebrating books and their impact on people's lives. Words like "celebrate," "positive vision," and "loyal" all have positive connotations. There's no indication of any negative emotions here—anger, disgust, fear, or sadness aren't present.

Could it be surprise? The tweet isn't expressing any astonishment or unexpectedness; rather, it's a statement of appreciation. So surprise doesn't seem to fit.

The strongest emotion here is joy. They're expressing happiness and promoting positivity related to books and reading. It aligns with serenity and ecstasy as part of the joy category.

I don't see any elements pointing towards fear or anxiety. Also, there's no trace of disgust or disinterest—on the contrary, it's all about appreciation.

So, considering all that, the emotion conveyed is joy.
