Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion behind it. The user is saying, "Correct. Pls dump these arrogant and disrespectful fans out of the #ChampionsLeague." 

First, the word "dump" suggests they want these fans removed, which implies frustration or dislike. The adjectives "arrogant" and "disrespectful" are strong negative descriptors indicating that the user has a negative view of these fans.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger includes annoyance and rage, disgust involves disinterest or dislike. Here, the user isn't just annoyed but seems to have a strong aversion, which leans more towards disgust rather than anger because they're not explicitly expressing a desire for confrontation or revenge, but rather wishing them away due to their behavior.

So, considering all this, the emotion conveyed is disgust.

**disgust**

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion is conveyed in this tweet: "USER USER Correct. USER pls dump these arrogant and disrespectful fans out of the #ChampionsLeague". The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, let me break down the tweet. It starts with "USER USER Correct." which seems like they're agreeing or responding to someone else. Then they say, "pls dump these arrogant and disrespectful fans out of the #ChampionsLeague".

So the main part is about wanting certain fans to be removed from the Champions League because they're acting arrogantly and disrespectfully. The words "dump," "arrogant," and "disrespectful" are strong negative terms.

I'm thinking about the emotion here. Anger would involve frustration or irritation, maybe evenrage. Disgust is more about feeling something is讨厌or repulsive. Fear is about anxiety or worry, which doesn't seem to fit here. Joy and surprise are positive emotions, so probably not.

The user is clearly upset with how these fans are behaving. They're using strong language ("dump," "arrogant," "disrespectful") which suggests they feel annoyed or angry. So it's more about anger rather than disgust because it's a reaction to others' behavior rather than something physically repulsive.

Wait, but sometimes when someone is really fed up with people's actions, does that fall under disgust? Like feeling disgusted by their behavior. Hmm, but in this case, the emotion seems more directed at wanting them removed, which sounds like frustration or anger.

So I think the emotion here is anger because they're expressing irritation and a desire to get rid of these fans due to their arrogance and disrespect.

The tweet expresses irritation and a desire to remove fans due to their behavior. The strong negative language indicates frustration rather than disgust. 

**anger**
