Alright, so I need to figure out which emotion the author of this tweet is conveying. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let's break down the tweet.

The tweet says: "How did #Messi score this long range free kick 🤷🏾♂️🤷🏾♂️🤷🏾♂️. He is the 🐐🐐🐐🐐 goats... #BarcaLiverpool #FCBLIV #ChampionsLeague"

First, I notice that the user is expressing surprise or amazement. They're asking how Messi scored such a long free kick, which suggests they're in disbelief. The use of repeated goats (🐐) and emojis like 🤷🏾♂️ indicates shock or astonishment. 

Looking at the emotion categories: surprise includes things like distraction and amazement, which fits here. The author isn't expressing anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or joy; it's more about being surprised by Messi's skill.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed is surprise.

Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion behind this tweet about Messi's free kick. Let me start by reading the tweet carefully.

The tweet says: "How did #Messi score this long range free kick 🤷🏾♂️🤷🏾♂️🤷🏾♂️. He is the 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐 goats 🐐, #BarcaLiverpool #FCBLIV #ChampionsLeague"

Alright, so first, the tweet is about Messi scoring a goal from a long-range free kick. The user seems amazed by this because they're asking "How did he do that?" That's pretty clear.

Looking at the emojis used: three shrug emojis 🤷🏾♂️ repeated. Shrug emojis usually express surprise or disbelief. They can convey that the person is flabbergasted or can't believe what happened.

Then there are a bunch of goat emojis 🐐, which stands for "🐐" as in "greatest of all time." So they're praising Messi by calling him the greatest player ever with multiple goats. That's definitely admiration and excitement.

The hashtags at the end mention #BarcaLiverpool, which is Barcelona vs Liverpool, likely a Champions League match, given the #ChampionsLeague hashtag. This adds context that it was an important game.

Putting it all together: The user is expressing amazement at Messi's incredible goal. They're using shrugs to show they can't believe it and are praising Messi highly. There's no negative emotion here—no anger or disgust, just pure surprise and admiration.

So among the options given (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise), the most fitting emotion is surprise. The repeated shrug emojis and the tone of disbelief make that clear.

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion the author of this tweet is expressing. Let me read the tweet carefully.

The tweet says: "How did #Messi score this long range free kick 🤷🏾♂️🤷🏾♂️🤷🏾♂️. He is the 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐 goats 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐 #BarcaLiverpool #FCBLIV #ChampionsLeague"

First, I notice that they're talking about Messi scoring a long-range free kick. That's impressive, right? So, the use of emojis might give me a clue. The first set of emojis are people shrugging their shoulders, which usually signifies surprise or disbelief.

Then, the author calls Messi "the 🐐🐐", and I know that 🐐 stands for "GOAT," which means Greatest Of All Time. So they're praising Messi, saying he's incredible. This praise definitely sounds like joy because someone is expressing admiration and happiness about Messi's skill.

Looking at the hashtags, it mentions #BarcaLiverpool, #FCBLIV (which I think refers to FC Barcelona vs Liverpool), and #ChampionsLeague, so this must be about a Champions League match between these two teams. The excitement of seeing Messi do something amazing would naturally lead someone to express joy.

The repeated shrugging emojis probably show that the author is in awe—like, "Wow, how did he do that?" That's definitely a surprised reaction but mixed with happiness because it's such an incredible moment. However, since the primary emotion here is about praising and celebrating Messi's talent, I think joy is more fitting than surprise.

So putting it all together: the author is expressing admiration and joy at Messi's exceptional skill in scoring that goal.
