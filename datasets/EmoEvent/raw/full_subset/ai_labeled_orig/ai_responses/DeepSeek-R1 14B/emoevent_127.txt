Alright, let me try to figure out the emotion in this tweet. So, the user is talking about World Book Day and promoting a book called "BeforeWeWereWicked" by Eric Jerome Dickey. They've included some emojis: a book emoji, another one, a pink love heart, and two smiling faces with a wink and another smiley.

First, I'll break down the content. The tweet is encouraging others to read the book, saying they won't regret it. The use of hearts and smiling emojis suggests positivity. They're excited about the book, maybe even happy that people will enjoy it.

Looking at the options: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to pick one. There's no sign of anger or frustration; instead, it's all positive reinforcement. Disgust isn't there eitherâ€”nothing negative is mentioned about the book or reading in general. Fear and anxiety aren't present because the tone is uplifting.

Sadness doesn't fit because the tweet is about celebrating books and recommending a read. Surprise? Well, maybe not necessarily surprise but more of an enthusiastic recommendation.

So, the emotion here seems to be joy. The author is expressing excitement and happiness about the book and encouraging others to read it. The emojis reinforce this positive feeling.
