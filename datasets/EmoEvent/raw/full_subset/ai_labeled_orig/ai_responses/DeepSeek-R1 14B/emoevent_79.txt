Okay, let's tackle this classification task. The user has provided a tweet and wants it classified into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says, "Happy #WorldBookDay! Follow our librarian, Max Crowther, on Twitter USER for the occasion! https://t.co/giqmuL5pss". The first word is "Happy", which immediately suggests a positive emotion. 

The mention of World Book Day is an event promoting reading and books, which are generally associated with positivity and enthusiasm. The author is encouraging others to follow Max Crowther, a librarian, on Twitter. This act of recommendation often conveys excitement or joy about sharing knowledge or engaging in literary activities.

Looking at the other elements: there's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or disgust. No fear or anxiety is present; instead, it's an invitation. Sadness isn't evident either—on the contrary, it's a celebratory tone. Surprise doesn't fit because there's nothing unexpected here.

So, considering all these factors, the emotion conveyed is clearly joy.
