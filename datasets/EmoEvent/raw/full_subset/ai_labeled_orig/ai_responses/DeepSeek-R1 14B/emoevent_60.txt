Alright, I need to classify this tweet's emotion from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

First, let me read the tweet carefully. The user says, "Absolutely ridiculous statement." That word "ridiculous" conveys a strong negative feeling. They're calling Bolton's actions part of a soap opera with "the worst characters," which shows disdain or dislike.

The hashtags used are #VenezuelaCoup and others related to the political figures involved, suggesting they're engaged in the situation but frustrated with how it's being handled.

Looking at the emotion categories:
- Anger: The tweet does express frustration, so anger is a possibility.
- Disgust: Using words like "ridiculous" and criticizing Bolton's approach might indicate disgust.
- Other emotions don't fit as well here.

Between anger and disgust, "disgust" seems more fitting because the user is expressing dislike for the statement and the tactics being used. They're not just angry but rather showing aversion to what's happening.

So, I think the emotion conveyed is disgust.

**disgust**

Okay, I need to classify this tweet's emotion from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

First, let me read the tweet carefully. The user says, "Absolutely ridiculous statement." That definitely sounds like they're expressing frustration or maybe irritation. Then they mention Bolton trying to create rifts in the chavista camp and using "worst characters" for his "soap opera." Using words like "ridiculous," "worst," and "soap opera" suggests that the author is not just annoyed but perhaps生气 (angry).

Looking at the hashtags: #VenezuelaCoup, #venezuela, #juanguaido, #nicolasmaduro. These are related to the political crisis in Venezuela, supporting Guaido and opposing Maduro.

So, putting it together: The author is calling Bolton's actions absurd and possibly undermining his efforts by saying he's using negative characters. This indicates a strong negative emotion, likely anger.
</think>

The tweet uses strong language like "ridiculous" and criticizes Bolton's actions, showing clear frustration or anger towards the situation.

**anger**

Alright, let's break down this problem step by step. The task is to classify a given tweet into one of six predefined emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll look at the tweet itself:
"Absolutely ridiculous statement. Bolton is trying to create rifts in the chavista camp, but chose the worst characters for his soap opera. #VenezuelaCoup #venezuela #juanguaido #nicolasmaduro https://t.co/vznihdhDIW"

The user starts with "Absolutely ridiculous statement." The word "ridiculous" immediately conveys a strong negative emotion, likely frustration or anger. They're calling something said by Bolton absurd.

Next, the tweet continues: "Bolton is trying to create rifts in the chavista camp..." Here, they're criticizing Bolton's actions. Using words like "trying" and "create rifts" suggests someone attempting to stir division, which could be seen as a negative tactic.

Then, "...but chose the worst characters for his soap opera." The term "soap opera" is used sarcastically or pejoratively here, indicating that the situation is being manipulated in an underhanded way. This adds to the negative sentiment.

The hashtags at the end are #VenezuelaCoup, which refers to a political crisis, and mentions of Juan Guaido and Nicolas Maduro, key figures in the Venezuelan political landscape. These indicate the tweet's context but don't directly impact the emotion conveyed.

Looking at the possible emotions:
- Anger: The use of "ridiculous" and criticism towards Bolton suggest frustration or anger.
- Disgust: There's a sense of distaste for the tactics mentioned, but it's more about anger than disgust.
- Fear: No indication of fear in the tweet.
- Joy/Serenity: Clearly not applicable; the tone is negative.
- Sadness/Grief: The emotion here isn't sadness but rather irritation or anger.

The most fitting emotion from the list is **anger**, as the language used reflects frustration and criticism towards Bolton's actions. While there's some element of disgust, the primary emotion conveyed is anger due to the strong negative terms used.

**anger**
