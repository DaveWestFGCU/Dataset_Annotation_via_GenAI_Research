They're highlighting an event (Champions League) and sharing a fact about Barcelona's performance over several years without a loss at home.

- Fear: The tone doesn't suggest anxiety or fear about upcoming events.
- Joy: "Great games" and positive info about Barcelona imply happiness or excitement.
