Alright, I'm trying to figure out the emotion behind this tweet. The user mentioned Episode 83 about having money for war but not feeding the poor. They also included several hashtags like #NotreDameCathedralFire, #Brexit, #Farage, etc.

First, the main content is aboutEpisode 83 which seems to discuss social issues related to wealth distribution and poverty amidst funding for war. This suggests frustration or concern, which might fall under anger or sadness. 

The inclusion of the Notre Dame Cathedral Fire hashtag indicates that the author is linking this event with broader societal issues, possibly showing disappointment or sadness over how resources are allocated.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger includes annoyance and rage; disgust includes disinterest; fear includes anxiety; joy includes serenity; sadness includes grief; surprise includes amazement. 

The tweet's content expresses a critique of current policies (money for war vs feeding the poor) which likely conveys frustration or disappointment. Frustration can be a form of anger but might also align with sadness if it's more about the state of affairs.

However, since the author is linking multiple issues and using hashtags to spread awareness, they might be expressing surprise at how resources are prioritized. But given that it's a critique, it's more likely to express anger or sadness.

Considering the context, the Notre Dame fire was a significant event, and mentioning it alongside the podcast topic could indicate a broader societal critique, leaning towards sadness or grief over such situations.

But since the primary focus is on wealth distribution and the money being allocated for war instead of feeding the poor, which is a direct critique, I think anger is more appropriate because it's pointing out an unfair situation that might make someone feel annoyed or frustrated.

Okay, so I need to classify the emotion of this tweet based on the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet in question is about Episode 83 titled "Got Money For War But Can't Feed The Poor," and it's linked with several hashtags like #NotreDameCathedralFire, #Brexit, #Farage, etc., along with a podcast link.

First, I'll analyze the content of the tweet. The title mentions having money for war but not being able to feed the poor. That sounds critical or maybe frustrated about how resources are allocated. Then there's the mention of the Notre-Dame Cathedral Fire, which is an event that caused widespread sadness and惋惜 globally.

Looking at the hashtags: #NotreDameCathedralFire is associated with a tragic event, so it might evoke sadness. The other hashtags like #Brexit and #Farage are related to political topics, possibly indicating some level of frustration or anger towards current events.

The tweet's primary message seems to be pointing out an inconsistency—allocating funds for war but neglecting the poor. This could express anger because it's highlighting a problem that the author might find unacceptable or unjust. The use of the hashtag #WealthDistribution also suggests concern about economic inequality, which can be a source of frustration.

I don't see any elements indicating joy, fear, surprise, or disgust in the message. It's more focused on critique and pointing out issues, which points towards anger. Therefore, I think the emotion conveyed here is anger.

Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire. The user provided a list of possible emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

First, let's look at the tweet: "Episode 83 - Got Money For War But Can't Feed The Poor #NotreDameCathedralFire #Brexit #Farage #WealthDistribution #podcast #podcasting #PodernFamily #entertainment". 

The tweet mentions the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire, which was a significant event. However, the main content seems to be about an episode titled "Got Money For War But Can't Feed The Poor." This title suggests concern or criticism regarding resource allocation—money spent on war versus the lack of funds for feeding the poor. 

The hashtags used are #NotreDameCathedralFire, #Brexit, #Farage, #WealthDistribution, along with some podcast-related ones. While the fire is mentioned, the focus seems to be more on wealth distribution and political topics like Brexit and Farage.

So, analyzing the emotion: The tweet's title implies a critical stance towards how resources are prioritized. This could indicate frustration or anger about societal issues. However, since it's pointing out a problem rather than expressing personal loss or sadness, I'm leaning towards "anger." Alternatively, maybe "sadness," but the tone seems more pointedly critical.

Wait, but the tweet is part of an episode title and includes several unrelated hashtags. The mention of the fire might be just another topic being covered in the podcast. So the primary emotion here isn't about the fire itself, which was a tragic event that might evoke sadness, but rather about the critique on wealth distribution.

Therefore, the emotion conveyed is likely "anger" because it's addressing an issue with frustration or criticism.
