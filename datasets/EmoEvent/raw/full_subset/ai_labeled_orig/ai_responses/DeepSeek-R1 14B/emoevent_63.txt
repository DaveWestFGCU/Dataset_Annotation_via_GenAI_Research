Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the emotion behind this tweet about the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire. Let me read it again: "The fire at #NotreDame reminded me of this paragraph from my work on the kingdom as a space. People mourn because spaces are not static, but active. #NotreDameCathedralFire https://t.co/CLUNAL3iF0"

Alright, so the author is talking about how the fire at Notre-Dame made them think of something they wrote. They mention that people mourn because spaces aren't static—they're active. The key words here are "mourn" and "active." 

When someone says people mourn, that usually conveys a sense of loss or sadness. The author is connecting the fire to this idea that spaces change and cause emotional responses. Using "mourn" directly ties into feelings of grief or sorrow.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I don't think it's any of the others. There's no indication of anger or disgust—more like a reflection on loss. Fear? Not really, unless they're anxious about something, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. Joy and surprise are definitely out since the context is negative.

So, sadness makes the most sense because the author is discussing mourning and the impact of losing such a significant space. The act of mourning itself is inherently tied with sadness.

Alright, let's try to figure out the emotion behind this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user mentioned that the fire reminded them of a specific paragraph from their work on the kingdom as a space. They talk about people mourning because spaces aren't static but active.

So, when I see words like "mourn" and the context of a significant place burning down, it makes me think of sadness or grief. Mourning usually implies sorrow or grief, which falls under sadness. There's also an element of loss here—losing such a historic building would likely evoke sad feelings.

I don't detect any anger or disgust in the tweet. It doesn't seem like the author is upset about something specific or expressing dislike. Fear isn't really there either; it's more about the emotional impact of the event rather than fear itself. Joy and surprise are also not present since the situation is tragic, so those emotions don't fit.

Therefore, the emotion conveyed here seems to be sadness because of the mourning mentioned and the loss associated with the fire.

Alright, let's try to figure out the emotion in this tweet. The user is sharing a tweet about the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire. They mention that the fire reminded them of a paragraph they wrote about spaces being active rather than static, and people mourning because of that.

First, I need to look at the content. They're reflecting on how the destruction of a space affects people emotionally. The use of "mourn" suggests sadness. Also, the fact that they're linking it to their work implies a deeper personal connection or reflection, which aligns with feeling sad about the loss.

Looking at the options: anger would involve frustration or rage, but there's no indication of that here. Disgust isn't present; the tweet is more reflective than disgusted. Fear might come into play with anxiety, but again, it's not the primary emotion here. Joy and surprise are clearly out of place in this context.

So, the main emotion seems to be sadness because they're talking about mourning and the impact of losing a significant space.
