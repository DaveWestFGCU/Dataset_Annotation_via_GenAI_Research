Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion is conveyed in this tweet about Greta Thunberg. The tweet says: "Gotta love this kid...... So much better than the doom & gloom #GretaThunberg https://t.co/hD3DkzM6oj". 

First, let's break down the components of the tweet. The author starts with "Gotta love this kid", which is a positive expression showing approval or affection towards Greta Thunberg. Then they say it's "so much better than the doom & gloom", contrasting Greta's approach with something negative.

The word "doom" and "gloom" usually evoke feelings of fear or anxiety, but here they're being used in a critical way. The author is probably tired of the negative rhetoric surrounding climate change, as often associated with Greta Thunberg's messaging. By saying it's better than that, they might be expressing relief or hope.

So, the sentiment seems to be positive because the author likes what Greta is doing and contrasts it favorably against other negative messages. The options for emotion are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Since the tweet is praising her and showing approval, "joy" fits here because it's a positive feeling.

Okay, so I need to classify the emotion in this tweet. The tweet says: "Gotta love this kid...... So much better than the doom & gloom #GretaThunberg" with a link attached.

First, let me break down the components of the tweet. The author starts by expressing approval with "Gotta love this kid". The use of "gotta love" is positive, indicating admiration or affection for Greta Thunberg. Then they compare her to "doom & gloom", which I know are terms often associated with negative feelings like despair or anxiety.

But the author says it's "so much better than" that doom and gloom. This suggests they're contrasting Greta's message, perhaps implying that while others might focus on negative aspects (like climate change), she brings a more positive or hopeful perspective.

Now, looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The author isn't expressing anger, disgust, fear, or sadness. They aren't surprised either; it's not an unexpected statement. Instead, the tone is appreciative and complimentary. "Gotta love this kid" conveys admiration, which falls under joy because it's a positive emotion.

The mention of doom and gloom could be seen as acknowledging negative emotions but shifting away from them to focus on Greta's positive influence. So overall, the primary emotion here is joy, expressing approval and positivity towards Greta Thunberg.

Okay, so I need to classify a tweet's emotion based on the given categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet is: "Gotta love this kid...... So much better than the doom & gloom #GretaThunberg https://t.co/hD3DkzM6oj"

First, I'll analyze the content of the tweet. The user starts with "Gotta love this kid", which sounds positive and affectionate. They mention Greta Thunberg, who is known for her activism on climate change. The phrase "doom & gloom" is commonly associated with negative or worrying messages, often linked to environmental issues.

The user seems to contrast their own positive sentiment ("gotta love this kid") with the "doom & gloom" narrative typically associated with Greta's message. So, they're highlighting a positive aspect despite the usual negative tone around her activism. The use of ellipses after "kid" might indicate some emphasis or maybe even a slight sarcastic tone, but overall, the main sentiment appears to be positive.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger is about irritation, disgust is about dislike, fear involves worry, joy is about happiness, sadness is about sorrow, and surprise is unexpected reactions. The tweet doesn't express any of these except for joy. The user's use of "gotta love" and their overall tone suggests they're happy or impressed by Greta Thunberg's approach.

I don't think it's anger because there's no sign of irritation. Disgust isn't present either; in fact, the opposite seems true. Fear is about anxiety, but the tweet doesn't evoke that. Sadness isn't here, and surprise would require something unexpected. So joy fits best as they're expressing a positive feeling towards Greta.
