Okay, let's try to figure out the emotion in this tweet. So, first, I need to read through the tweet carefully. The user is talking about two characters: one loyal to his Queen and another loyal to her people. Both died protecting their respective sides—loyal Queen or her people. Then they mention RIP House Mormont, which probably refers to a character from Game of Thrones who died. There are also several hashtags related to the show.

I know that when people tweet about characters dying in a show they like, especially if it's a favorite, they often feel sad or emotional. The mention of "RIP" is typically associated with RIP rest in peace, which is used for deceased loved ones, indicating sadness. Also, the hashtags are all related to Game of Thrones and specific episodes, showing that the user is deeply involved with the show.

Looking at the emotions given: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet isn't expressing any of these except possibly sadness because it's about characters dying, which usually brings up feelings of sorrow or grief.

I don't think it's surprise because the death might have been expected since it's Game of Thrones and people know that many characters die. It's not fear unless they're scared of the outcome, but more likely, it's the sadness of losing a character they care about.

Alright, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to classify a tweet based on the emotion conveyed, choosing from anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It talks about two characters dying while protecting their Queen and her people, mentions RIP House Mormont, and includes several Game of Thrones-related hashtags. The tone seems somber because they're talking about deaths and using "RIP," which stands for rest in peace, indicating sadness.

Looking at the emotion categories, joy doesn't fit here since it's a sad topic. Fear? There's no indication of fear in the tweet. Disgust or anger? No obvious signs there either. Surprise? Maybe not directly related to the content. So, the most fitting emotion is sadness because the tweet reflects on deaths and loss.

I should make sure I'm only using the specified categories and not considering any other emotions like grief or pensiveness beyond sadness. Yeah, that makes sense.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out the emotion behind this tweet about Game of Thrones. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the tweet mentions two characters: one loyal to his Queen and another loyal to her people. It talks about both dying while protecting their respective figures—loyalty seems to be a big theme here. The tweet ends with "RIP House Mormont," which I know is referencing the death of Theon Greyjoy in the series.

Now, looking at the content, it's expressing a sense of loss and tragedy. The deaths are depicted as noble acts, but they still result in sadness. There's no indication of anger or disgust; instead, the tone feels somber. The hashtags include #GOT8E3 which refers to episode 3 of season 8, known for being emotional and pivotal.

The author is likely feeling sad about these character deaths. They're reflecting on the loyalty and sacrifice, which naturally evokes a sense of loss and grief. There's no element of surprise or fear here; it's more about mourning the characters.

So, considering all this, the emotion conveyed is sadness.
