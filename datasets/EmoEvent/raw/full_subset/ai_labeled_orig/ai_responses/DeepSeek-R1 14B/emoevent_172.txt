Okay, so I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion the author intended to convey. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Looking at the tweet: "üêêüêêüêê It's official. Lionel Messi IS NOT HUMAN. An inch-perfect free kick from the USER icon makes it 3-0! #BARLIV #ChampionsLeague FOLLOW LIVE: https://t.co/zIYfs9Twcg https://t.co/9AEIBdFiQM"

First, I notice a lot of emojis with goats (üêê). That's interesting. Sometimes people use goat emojis to indicate that someone is the best or has exceptional skills. So maybe it's admiration.

The text says Messi IS NOT HUMAN and describes his free kick as inch-perfect. This sounds like praise because calling someone superhuman often conveys awe or astonishment.

Also, the mention of the score being 3-0 suggests a positive outcome for Messi's team. The hashtags are about Champions League, which is a big competition, so it's likely related to excitement about a match.

The author is clearly impressed by Messi's skill and the moment in the game. Words like "official," "USER icon" (probably refers to Messi as an iconic user), "makes it 3-0!" all sound positive and exhilarating.

Putting it all together, the emotion here seems to be joy or maybe surprise because of the incredible performance. However, since the tweet is expressing admiration and excitement more than being surprised, I think joy fits better.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion. Let me read through the tweet again. It says "üêêüêêüêê  It's official. Lionel Messi IS NOT HUMAN." Then talks about a perfect free kick making it 3-0 and includes some hashtags related to the Champions League and a live link.

Alright, first, the emojis are goats üêê repeated three times. I remember sometimes people use goat emojis as references to "Greatest Of All Time" or something like that, so maybe it's admiration. Then the author calls Messi "not human," which is clearly an exaggeration but in a positive way, showing he's amazed by Messi's skill.

The next part mentions a perfect free kick leading to a 3-0 score. That sounds like a great moment for the team, especially if it's Bar√ßa playing against someone. The hashtags are about Champions League and live updates, so this is likely from a football match they're following closely.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet seems to express excitement and amazement over Messi's performance. "It's official. Lionel Messi IS NOT HUMAN." That phrase is definitely expressing awe or admiration. The exclamation marks also indicate strong positive emotions.

The other options don't fit as well. There's no sign of anger, disgust, fear, or sadness here. Surprise could be possible if it was an unexpected event, but the use of emojis and the tone seems more celebratory than surprised. So joy or serenity, which are under the 'joy' category, seem to fit best.

I think the main emotion is joy because the author is celebrating Messi's skills and the goal. They're showing excitement and happiness about the situation.

Alright, let's break this down. The user provided a tweet about Lionel Messi scoring a perfect free kick in the Champions League final. They want me to classify the emotion conveyed.

First, I look at the content: Messi is described as "not human," which is a compliment showing amazement. The exclamation marks and emojis (üêê) emphasize excitement. Words like "inch-perfect" and "makes it 3-0" show positive sentiment.

Considering the options, joy seems to fit because the tweet expresses admiration and happiness about Messi's skill. There's no sign of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise‚Äîjust pure enthusiasm.
