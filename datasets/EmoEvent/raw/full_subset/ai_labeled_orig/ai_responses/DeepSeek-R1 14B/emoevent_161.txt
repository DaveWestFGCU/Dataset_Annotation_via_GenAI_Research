Okay, I'm trying to figure out the emotion conveyed in this tweet about World Book Day. The tweet starts with a link and mentions it's World Book and Copyright Day. The author is celebrating the joy of reading, highlighting that it's fun and good for the brain. They also include several book-related hashtags.

I need to classify the emotion from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. 

The word "joy" stands out here because the tweet explicitly says "celebrate the joy of reading." Also, using words like "fun" and "great for our brains" conveys a positive feeling. There's no indication of any negative emotions or surprise.

So, the emotion is clearly joy.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion it conveys. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, let me read the tweet carefully: "Today is World Book and Copyright Day, so what better time to celebrate the joy of reading? Not only is it fun, but it's great for our brains too! #book #books #bookish etc."

The author starts by mentioning the day, which is a positive event. They use words like "celebrate," "joy of reading," and describe reading as "fun" and beneficial for the brain. The hashtags are all related to books in a positive light.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger doesn't fit because there's no negative or aggressive language. Disgust is about dislike, but again, nothing negative here. Fear would involve worry or anxiety, which isn't present. Sadness isn't applicable as the tone is uplifting. Surprise implies unexpected news, but it's a known event being celebrated.

The key words are "joy of reading" and positive reinforcement about reading. The author clearly expresses happiness and enthusiasm. So, the emotion here is joy.
