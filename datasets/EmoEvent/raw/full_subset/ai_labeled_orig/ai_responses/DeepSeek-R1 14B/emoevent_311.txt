Okay, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet is about the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire and mentions modernist architects wanting to redesign it into a shopping mall.

First, let me read the tweet carefully. It says that every impious modernist architect wants to take advantage of the fire to redesign the cathedral into a futuristic shopping mall. The word "impious" suggests a negative connotation towards those architects, implying they're disrespectful or blasphemous in their approach.

The author is expressing strong disapproval or opposition to this idea. They might be concerned about preserving the historical and cultural significance of the cathedral. Using words like "take advantage" indicates frustration or irritation with the situation.

Looking at the emotion categories, anger includes annoyance and rage. The tweet's tone seems more annoyed or frustrated rather than full-blown anger. Disgust could also be a possibility if the author feels the proposal is repulsive, but the primary emotion here seems to be more about opposition and frustration.

Fear isn't really present unless there's an underlying anxiety about the future of the cathedral, but that's not the main focus. Joy and surprise are clearly not applicable here. Sadness might come into play regarding the loss caused by the fire, but the tweet is directed more towards a current issue rather than the event itself.

So, considering all this, I think the emotion conveyed is anger because of the strong negative stance against the architects' plans.

Okay, so I need to classify the emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user provided a list of possible emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

Looking at the tweet, it says that every impious modernist architect wants to take advantage of the fire to redesign the cathedral into a futuristic shopping mall. The word "impious" suggests disapproval or disrespect towards something sacred. Also, using words like "take advantage" and "redesign as some futuristic shopping mall" indicates frustration or opposition to how others are handling the situation.

I don't see any elements of fear, joy, surprise, or sadness here. The main emotion seems to be frustration with how people are responding to the disaster. So, I think anger fits best because it's about disapproval and opposition.

Alright, let's try to figure out the emotion behind this tweet about Notre Dame Cathedral. The user is talking about how every impious modernist architect wants to take advantage of the fire to redesign the cathedral into a futuristic shopping mall. Hmm, that sounds pretty negative.

So first, I should break down the words used. Words like "impious" and "modernist architects" might be expressing some frustration or anger towards those people. The idea of turning a historic site into a shopping mall probably goes against traditional values, which could make the speaker feel upset or annoyed.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Anger seems possible because they're criticizing others' actions. Disgust might be there too if they're expressing dislike for the idea, but I'm not sure if it's more about anger or disgust.

Wait, the tweet is抱怨那些建筑师想利用火灾来重建，可能带有对他们的不满和愤怒。所以更倾向于anger。Disgust更多是厌恶，比如觉得某个东西很恶心，而这里更多的是对行为的不满，所以可能是anger。

再想想，作者用了“every single”这样的强调词，显示出很强的情绪，可能是在发泄 frustration or anger. 所以综合来看，最合适的应该是anger。
