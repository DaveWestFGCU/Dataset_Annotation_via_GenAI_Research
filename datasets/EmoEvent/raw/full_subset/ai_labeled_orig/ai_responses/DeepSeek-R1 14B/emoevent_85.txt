Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion in this tweet. Let me read it again carefully.

The tweet says: "'Don' t litter' 'Care about the eath' This really gave me hope for the future. Perhaps a child made this? Future vegan? ❤️ #hope #dontlitter #earth #motherearth #veganvibes #enviroment #gretathunberg @ Løten https://t.co/Ipzk2ZLC1m"

First, I notice that the tweet is about littering and caring for the earth. The user expresses hope for the future, mentions a child possibly making it, refers to becoming vegan, and uses a heart emoji. They also tag Greta Thunberg.

So, the emotion here seems positive. Hope is a strong indicator of joy or maybe even surprise, but more likely joy because it's about positivity and looking forward to a better future. The mention of a child could imply innocence and potential for change, which adds to the hopeful sentiment.

The hashtags like #hope, #veganvibes, and the heart emoji reinforce a positive and optimistic feeling. There's no sign of anger, disgust, fear, or surprise; it's all about looking on the bright side.

Therefore, the emotion conveyed is joy.
