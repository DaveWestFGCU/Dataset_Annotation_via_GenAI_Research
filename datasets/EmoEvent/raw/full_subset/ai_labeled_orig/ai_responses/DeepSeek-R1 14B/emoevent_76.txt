Okay, so I need to classify this tweet into one of the given emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let's read the tweet carefully.

The user says they wouldn't be surprised if an investigation reveals Islamic terrorists' involvement in the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire. They express that it's a "such a loss, such a shame" and include the hashtag #NotreDameCathedralFire.

First, I should analyze the content and tone of the tweet. The mention of terrorism involvement suggests anger or frustration towards the situation. The phrase "such a loss, such a shame" indicates sadness but also implies disappointment or disgust at the possibility of terrorism causing it. 

The user isn't expressing fear or surprise here; they're making a statement that shows they expect something negative (terrorism) to be involved. This expectation coupled with the sorrow over the event might lean towards anger because of the implication of blaming others, which can evoke frustration.

Alternatively, sadness is also present because of the tragedy, but since they're speculating about terrorist involvement, it adds an element of anger directed at those responsible or the situation as a whole.

So, between anger and sadness. The mention of expecting Islamic terrorists might add a layer of anger beyond just the loss itself.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what emotion the author of this tweet is conveying regarding the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The tweet says: "Wouldn’t be surprised if eventually investigation revel’s Islamic terrorists involvement. Such a loss, such a shame #NotreDameCathedralFire". 

First, I need to analyze the content and the sentiment behind it. The user mentions not being surprised if Islamic terrorists are found involved in the fire. This suggests they have a suspicion or perhaps a belief that terrorism might be behind the incident. Then, they express that it's "such a loss, such a shame," which clearly conveys negative emotions related to the event.

Looking at the emotion categories provided: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to pick one that best fits the sentiment here.

The mention of Islamic terrorists could imply anger towards them or frustration with authorities for not preventing it, but the primary emotion in the latter part is "such a loss" and "such a shame." These phrases are indicative of sadness because they express grief over the destruction and the impact on something significant like a historical cathedral.

While there's an element of surprise in suggesting terrorist involvement, which might initially make me think of the 'surprise' category, the focus seems more on the negative outcome rather than being amazed or distracted. The main emotion is about the tragedy and the sorrow felt because of it.

So, considering all this, the most relevant emotion here is sadness.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the emotion behind this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user wrote, "Wouldn't be surprised if eventually investigation reveals Islamic terrorists involvement. Such a loss, such a shame #NotreDameCathedralFire." 

First, I need to break down what's being expressed here. The user starts by saying they wouldn't be surprised if Islamic terrorists were involved in the fire. That suggests they have a suspicion or belief about the cause of the fire. Then, they express that it's a "such a loss, such a shame." 

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to pick one.

The mention of Islamic terrorists might indicate some level of anger, maybe towards them or frustration with what happened. But is it primarily anger? Or is there another emotion stronger?

When they say "such a loss, such a shame," that sounds like sadness or grief about the destruction of something important—the cathedral. The cathedral is a significant cultural and historical site, so its damage would naturally evoke sadness.

But wait, does the mention of terrorists add any other emotion? It could be fear if they're worried about future attacks, but I don't think that's the main feeling here. Alternatively, anger towards those responsible. 

However, the primary emotions expressed are about the loss and the shame, which point more towards sadness rather than anger or fear. The user is reacting to the destruction itself rather than expressing fear of further events or anger as the main emotion.

So I think the dominant emotion here is sadness because they're mourning the loss of Notre Dame. Even though there's a mention of terrorism, the focus is on the tragedy and the sorrow it brings.
