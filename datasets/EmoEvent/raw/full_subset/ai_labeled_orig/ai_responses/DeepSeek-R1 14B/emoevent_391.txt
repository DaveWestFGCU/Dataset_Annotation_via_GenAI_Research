Alright, so I've got this tweet that needs to be classified into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The tweet is about the coalition of various groups attacking Greta Thunberg and mentions science denial, carnism, and other issues.

First, let me break down the content. The user is talking about a coalition involving white supremacists, human supremacists, and others targeting Greta Thunberg. They call it "vile" and mention that science denial is part of this movement which is underpinned by things like anthropocentrism, speciesism, racism.

The emotion conveyed here seems strong because they're using words like "vile," which implies a sense of disgust or disapproval. The attack on Greta Thunberg is described negatively, and the mention of these ideologies suggests that the author finds them repulsive. There's also a critique of science denial, which aligns with the broader issues Thunberg is highlighting.

Looking at the options, anger involves annoyance or rage. While the tweet does criticize these groups, the choice of words like "vile" leans more towards disgust rather than pure anger. Disgust can include disapproval and aversion, which fits here because the author is expressing strong dislike for these ideologies.

Fear would be if there was a sense of threat or anxiety. There's none of that here; it's more about condemnation. Sadness isn't present either since there's no indication of sorrow but rather judgment. Joy and surprise are clearly not applicable given the tone.

So, putting it all together, the emotion is disgust.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion based on the given categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Let me start by reading the tweet carefully.

The tweet says: ".USER The coalition of violent ideologies of #AfD #UKIP white supremacists and HUMAN SUPREMACISTS attacking #GretaThunberg is vile. SCIENCE DENIAL is synonymous with the current dominion of #carnism, underpinned by UN-REACHABLES. #Anthropocentrism #Speciesism #Racism"

First, I notice that the author is talking about several groups: AfD, UKIP, white supremacists, and human supremacists. They describe their ideologies as "violent" and call them "vile." The mention of attacking Greta Thunberg suggests they're upset or critical of these groups' actions towards her.

The tweet also talks about science denial being linked to carnism, which I think refers to the belief that humans are superior to other species. They mention this is underpinned by "UN-REACHABLES," but it's a bit unclear what that means exactly. The hashtags at the end include terms like Anthropocentrism, Speciesism, and Racism, which all relate to ideologies of human superiority or racism.

So, breaking this down, the author is expressing strong negative feelings towards these groups' actions against Greta Thunberg. Words like "vile" show disgust. They're also denouncing science denial and various forms of supremacy, which indicates a deep dislike for these ideologies.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger involves irritation or rage, while disgust relates to disapproval or aversion. The author isn't just angry about the actions but seems to be expressing a strong sense of disapproval towards the ideologies themselves. The use of words like "vile" and the overall tone of condemnation points more towards disgust rather than pure anger.

I don't see any elements of fear, joy, sadness, or surprise in this tweet. It's all about denouncing certain groups and their beliefs, which fits better under disgust.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion it conveys. The user provided a list of emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I have to pick only one.

First, let me read the tweet carefully. It says, "The coalition of violent ideologies of #AfD #UKIP white supremacists and HUMAN SUPREMACISTS attacking #GretaThunberg is vile. SCIENCE DENIAL is synonymous with the current dominion of #carnism, underpinned by UN-REACHABLES. #Anthropocentrism #Speciesism #Racism."

The tweet is talking about various groups that are labeled as violent ideologies, including white supremacists and human supremacists. It mentions they're attacking Greta Thunberg, who's a well-known environmental activist. The author seems to be criticizing these groups for their stance against science denial and other supremacist ideas.

Breaking down the words used: "vile" is an adjective that conveys strong dislike or disgust. Terms like "science denial," "carnism," "anthropocentrism," "speciesism," and "racism" are all concepts that relate to harmful ideologies. The overall tone seems critical and disapproving.

The emotion here isn't anger, although those groups' actions might be seen as angry. But the word "vile" suggests a feeling of disgust or strong dislike towards their ideologies and actions against Greta Thunberg. There's no indication of fear, joy, sadness, or surprise; it's more about condemning these groups for their beliefs.

So, putting it together, the primary emotion is disgust because the author strongly disapproves of these ideologies and the attack on Greta.
