Okay, I need to classify the emotion in the given tweet. The tweet says, "I want to visit this beautiful museum ðŸ˜¢ it was museum not just another church #NotreDameCathedralFire". 

First, let me break down the components of the tweet. The user expresses a desire to visit the museum but corrects themselves, pointing out that it's not just another church. They also include an emoji of a crying face ðŸ˜¢, which typically indicates sadness or tears.

The mention of Notre Dame Cathedral Fire suggests they're referring to the recent event where the cathedral caught fire. So, the context is about the destruction of a significant building, likely causing emotional distress.

Looking at the possible emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The emoji used is a tearful face, which aligns with sadness. The user's statement expresses a wish to visit something beautiful but seems to be reacting to its loss due to the fire. This would evoke feelings of sorrow or grief.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear beyond what's related to the event, joy, or surprise in the tweet. The main emotion is sadness because they're mourning the loss of a place they wanted to visit.

Alright, let's break down how I arrived at the classification of **sadness** for the given tweet.

First, I read the tweet: "I want to visit this beautiful museum ðŸ˜¢ it was museum not just another church #NotreDameCathedralFire". The user expresses a desire to visit a museum but clarifies that it's specifically Notre-Dame Cathedral, which is a church and also suffered a fire.

The emoji used here is ðŸ˜¢, which clearly conveys sadness or grief. This emotion aligns with the category of sadness in our list, which includes pensiveness and grief.

Additionally, the mention of the Notre-Dame Cathedral Fire suggests that the user might be reflecting on the loss caused by the fire. The combination of wanting to visit a place that's been affected by such an event likely adds to feelings of sadness.

I considered other emotions like surprise or fear but found no evidence in the tweet to suggest those. There's no indication of anger or disgust, and joy is clearly not present given the context of the fire and the emotional reaction shown.
