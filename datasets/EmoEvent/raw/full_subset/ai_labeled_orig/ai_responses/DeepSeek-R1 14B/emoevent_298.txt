Record: "Guaid√≥ wants you to believe that he is the only responsible and democratic alternative to the authoritarian "usurper" Maduro, but what he is doing in #Venezuela right now is incredibly dangerous and irresponsible: he is actively pushing the country to the brink of civil war."

Alright, let's break down this tweet. The author is talking about Juan Guaido wanting people to believe he's the democratic alternative to Maduro. But then they say what he's doing is dangerous and irresponsible, pushing the country towards civil war.

So, I need to figure out the emotion here. The word "dangerous" and "irresponsible" have negative connotations, but more than that, the mention of civil war implies a sense of impending crisis or doom. That makes me think of fear because they're highlighting potential threats and chaos.

Looking at other emotions: anger might be there, but it's not just about being upset; it's more about concern for what's coming. Disgust isn't as prominent since the focus is on the consequence rather than dislike. Sadness could be a factor, but again, the emphasis is on fear of future events.

So yeah, fear seems to fit best because the author is warning against an impending dangerous situation.

Alright, so I need to figure out which emotion this tweet conveys. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The tweet is about Juan Guaido wanting people to believe he's a responsible democratic alternative to Maduro, who's called an authoritarian "usurper." But the author says what Guaido is doing is dangerous and irresponsible, pushing the country towards civil war.

Okay, so the author is criticizing Guaido's actions. The words used are strong: "dangerous," "irresponsible," and "brink of civil war" all carry negative connotations. They're expressing concern or disapproval about Guaido's behavior.

Now, looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

Is it anger? The author is critical but not necessarily angry. Disapproval more than outright anger.

Disgust? That's when someone feels something is repulsive. Here, the focus is on Guaido's actions being harmful, which might lean towards disgust because of the strong negative judgment.

Fear? Not really; the tweet isn't about feeling scared but rather condemning an action.

Sadness? It doesn't seem to be expressing sorrow but more of a critique.

Surprise? No, it's not presenting something unexpected.

So, between anger and disgust. Anger is more about irritation or outrage, while disgust is about disapproval or finding something repulsive. Since the author is strongly disapproving of Guaido's actions, I think disgust fits better.

**disgust**

Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this tweet. The user provided a statement about Juan Guaido and Nicolas Maduro. I need to determine which emotion the author intended to convey from the given list.

First, looking at the content: The tweet criticizes Guaido for being dangerous and irresponsible, pushing Venezuela towards civil war. Words like "incredibly dangerous" and "irresponsible" carry negative connotations. 

Now, considering emotions: Anger is a strong emotion often expressed through criticism or harsh words. Disgust could also fit, but it's more about feeling something is repulsive. Fear isn't really present here; the tweet isn't expressing anxiety but rather judgment. Sadness might come into play if there's lamentation, which isn't evident. Surprise doesn't seem right because there's no shock or unexpected info.

The tone seems to be one of strong disapproval and frustration, pointing towards anger. So I think the emotion here is anger.
