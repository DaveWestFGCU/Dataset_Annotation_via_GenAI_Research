Okay, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion. Let me first read through it carefully.

The tweet starts with "Happy #WorldBookDay!" That immediately tells me there's a positive tone here. The use of "Happy" is a strong indicator of joy or excitement. 

Next, the author mentions that over 1 million books have been borrowed from QNL in the past year. This seems like a positive achievement, something to celebrate. They're probably proud or happy about this statistic.

Then there's a challenge: "We challenge you to read a book every month!" Challenging others in a friendly way usually conveys enthusiasm and positivity, which again points towards joy.

They also ask, "Which books do you plan on adding to your list?" This is engaging the audience, encouraging interaction, which adds to the uplifting vibe.

Finally, they thank someone for images and include a link. The gratitude expressed here is another positive emotion, reinforcing that the overall sentiment is happy.

Looking at the options: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. "Happy" falls under joy, so that's the primary emotion here. There's no indication of any other emotions like surprise or fear; everything seems upbeat and celebratory.
