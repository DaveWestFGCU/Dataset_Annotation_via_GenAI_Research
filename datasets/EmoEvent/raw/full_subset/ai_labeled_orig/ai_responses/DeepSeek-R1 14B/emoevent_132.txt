Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion conveyed in this specific tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral Fire. The tweet is: ".USER branded 'almighty half wit' by West Yorkshire fire chief USER for this 'ludicrous' tweet #NotreDameCathedralFire https://t.co/ZktPthFtNw"

First, I'll break down the components of the tweet to understand its content and tone. The user is mentioning that someone was branded as an "almighty half wit" by a fire chief from West Yorkshire. The term "half wit" seems derogatory, implying that the person is not very intelligent or is being mocked. Additionally, the word "ludicrous" is used to describe the tweet, which means it's considered extremely silly or unreasonable.

The use of words like "branded," "almighty half wit," and "ludicrous" suggests a negative sentiment towards the tweet in question. The fire chief is clearly expressing criticism or disdain for the user's tweet. This indicates that the emotion being conveyed isn't positive; it's more likely to be frustration, mockery, or disappointment.

Looking at the list of emotions provided: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to determine which one fits best here. Anger is often associated with strong negative feelings like frustration or irritation. Given that the fire chief is labeling someone as a "half wit" and calling their tweet "ludicrous," it seems like there's a sense of annoyance or criticism, which falls under anger.

Disgust could also be a possibility because the words used show disdain. However, disgust usually relates more to feelings of revulsion or厌恶 towards something. In this case, while there is some contempt, the primary emotion seems to be the frustration or irritation directed at the tweet's content and the person who made it.

Fear isn't really applicable here unless the tweet was causing anxiety, which doesn't seem to be the case. Joy and surprise are clearly not fitting because the tone is negative. Sadness might come into play if there were expressions of grief, but again, this seems more about criticism than sadness.

Therefore, considering the language used and the context (a fire chief criticizing a tweet), the emotion is best classified as anger. The words chosen reflect frustration or irritation towards the individual's actions or statements regarding the Notre Dame Cathedral Fire.

Okay, so I need to classify the emotion in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral Fire. The user was branded as an "almighty half wit" by a fire chief from West Yorkshire for their tweet, which he called "ludicrous." Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the tweet mentions that the user received this brand name and that it was labeled as ludicrous. Words like "half wit" and "ludicrous" have negative connotations. The fire chief is criticizing the user's tweet, which probably made the user feel bad about themselves. 

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet isn't expressing any of the positive emotions like joy or serenity. It doesn't seem to be about fear or surprise either. Disgust could fit if it's about disliking something, but here the focus is more on being called a fool rather than hating something. 

The key emotion here is likely sadness because the user was mocked and publicly labeled negatively, which can lead to feelings of embarrassment, shame, or hurt. Sadness encompasses these emotions as well. So I think the most relevant category is sadness.

**sadness**

Alright, so I need to classify the emotion in this tweet. Let's break it down.

First, the user mentions being branded as an "almighty half wit" by a fire chief from West Yorkshire. That sounds like they're calling the user stupid or not very intelligent. The word "ludicrous" is also used, which means something that's absurd or ridiculous.

Now, thinking about emotions, anger is when someone feels annoyed or upset. Here, the user seems to be upset by being called a halfwit and their tweet labeled as ludicrous. They might feel offended or annoyed by this branding from the fire chief. There's no indication of disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. It's more about feeling angered or annoyed.

So, putting it together, the emotion is likely anger because of the negative labels given.
</think>

The tweet expresses **anger** due to being labeled negatively by the fire chief.
