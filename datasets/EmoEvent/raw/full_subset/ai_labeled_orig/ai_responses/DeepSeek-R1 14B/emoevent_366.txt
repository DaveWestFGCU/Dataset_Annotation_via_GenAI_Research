Okay, let me try to figure out the emotion behind this tweet. The user mentioned something about "rich folk just broke" and then referenced Endgame's opening weekend collection along with hashtags related to the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire. I'm a bit confused because there are two main topics here: one is the cathedral fire, which is a tragic event, and the other is Avengers Endgame's opening weekend.

The user seems to be connecting the "rich folk" with breaking into something, possibly Endgame's collection numbers? Maybe they're upset about how much money was made from the movie, especially since Notre-Dame had just suffered a fire. The use of "just broke" could imply anger or frustration towards the wealthy exploiting or overshadowing a tragic event.

But wait, maybe it's more about surprise. They might be surprised that despite such a significant event as the cathedral burning down, people are still focused on movie-related news. Or perhaps they're highlighting how quickly something else took precedence over a major world event, which could be surprising.

I'm torn between anger and surprise. The mention of "rich folk" breaking into USER's collection might suggest frustration or anger towards those exploiting the situation for profit. On the other hand, mixing two unrelated events so abruptly could come off as surprising.

Considering the hashtags used are both about Notre-Dame and Avengers, it's likely the author is pointing out the contrast between a tragic event and a pop culture phenomenon. This juxtaposition might be intended to highlight how quickly people move on or focus elsewhere, which could be seen as a form of surprise or maybe even disgust at the lack of attention to the cathedral fire.

But I think the main emotion here is surprise because the author is blending two completely different topics in one tweet, drawing attention to the unexpected shift in public interest. Alternatively, it might be frustration or anger towards the prioritization of movie earnings over a significant cultural loss like Notre-Dame's fire.

Hmm, maybe I should consider context more. The Notre-Dame fire was a major news event globally, and the Avengers Endgame was also a huge release. If someone is pointing out that despite such a tragedy, people are still talking about a movie, it might be to express anger at how trivial things take precedence over serious events.

So, putting it all together, I think the emotion conveyed here is more likely sadness because of the tragic event and frustration or anger towards the distraction caused by something like a movie's success. But since we have to choose one emotion from the given list, and considering the possible surprise at the contrast, maybe it's closer to surprise.

Wait no, the user is probably frustrated that despite the fire, people are more interested in the movie. That frustration falls under anger or perhaps disgust because of the lack of empathy. But the primary emotion might be sadness because they're reacting to a tragic event and its overshadowing by something less important.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's better to go with surprise since the tweet combines two unexpected topics. Alternatively, if the author is upset about the distraction, then anger or disgust makes sense. However, given that the main event is Notre-Dame's fire, which is inherently saddening, and the comparison to a movie might be highlighting the contrast in emotions.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The tweet is using hashtags for both events, but the mention of "rich folk just broke" suggests anger towards those who are exploiting or making money off something trivial when there's a serious tragedy. So maybe the emotion is anger.

Alright, let me try to figure this out. The user wants me to classify a tweet into one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The tweet is about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire and mentions something about rich folks breaking into USER Endgame's opening weekend collection.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says, "The rich folk just broke USER Endgame's opening weekend collection #NotreDame #NotreDameCathedralFire #NotreDameCathedral USER USER #endgame #Avengers #AvengersEndgame." Hmm, that seems a bit confusing with all the "USER" mentions. Maybe it's a placeholder for usernames or something.

Breaking down the content: The Notre Dame Cathedral fire is a tragic event that happened in 2019. People around the world were saddened by this because it's such an important cultural and historical site. Now, the tweet mentions rich folks breaking into something related to Endgame's opening weekend collection. I'm not entirely sure what "USER Endgame" refers to—it could be a username or maybe a typo.

Putting it together: The user is linking the Notre Dame fire with some event involving rich people and Endgame. But wait, there's no clear expression of emotion here. It just states facts or events without using any emotional language. So I'm thinking about what emotions are being conveyed here.

Looking at the options:
- Anger: If someone is upset about something, they might use strong words. But this tweet doesn't seem angry.
- Disgust: Maybe if the user dislikes rich people exploiting something, but again, it's not explicit.
- Fear: No indication of fear here.
- Joy: Unlikely given the context of a fire and breaking into collections.
- Sadness: The Notre Dame fire is inherently sad, so maybe this is the emotion.
- Surprise: There's nothing surprising stated here.

Wait, but the tweet doesn't express any emotions directly. It's more of an informative or perhaps critical statement. However, considering the context of the Notre Dame fire, which was a globally tragic event, people naturally felt sad. The mention of rich folks and breaking into something could imply criticism but not necessarily sadness unless it's in reaction to the fire itself.

So maybe the user is expressing sadness about the fire, even though they're also talking about another event. Alternatively, if the tweet is sarcastic or critical, it might lean towards anger or disgust, but without explicit words showing those emotions, it's hard to tell.

I think the safest assumption here is that the primary emotion intended is sadness because of the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The other parts of the tweet are either unrelated or not explicitly emotional.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what emotion this tweet is conveying. The user provided a specific list of emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. I need to pick the one that best fits.

First, let's read the tweet carefully: "The rich folk just broke USER Endgame's opening weekend collection #NotreDame #NotreDameCathedralFire #NotreDameCathedral USER USER #endgame #Avengers #AvengersEndgame"

Hmm, okay. The tweet is talking about the rich people affecting Endgame's opening weekend collection. But wait, that doesn't seem to make sense because I know that "breaking" in this context might not be related to Notre Dame's fire.

Wait a second, the user included some hashtags: #NotreDameCathedralFire and others like #AvengersEndgame. The main event here is the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. So the tweet is somehow linking that event with Endgame's opening.

The phrase "broke USER Endgame's opening weekend collection" – perhaps "USER" is a placeholder for someone or something else? Maybe it's a typo or an attempt to avoid mentioning something directly.

Looking at the overall sentiment, the user seems to be pointing out that despite a significant event like the Notre-Dame fire (which would naturally draw a lot of attention and possibly affect movie openings), "Endgame" still had a strong opening weekend. So they're suggesting that even with such a major distraction (the fire), Endgame's collection wasn't affected, implying it was so successful.

So, what emotion is behind this? It might be expressing surprise because the success of Endgame despite the tragic event is unexpected or impressive. Alternatively, could it be sadness? But I don't think that's the case here.

The tweet doesn't express anger towards the rich folk; more like pointing out a fact. Disgust doesn't fit either. Fear? Not really. Joy? Maybe, but surprise seems more fitting because the resilience of Endgame's opening is surprising.

So, after considering all options, I think the emotion intended here is surprise.
