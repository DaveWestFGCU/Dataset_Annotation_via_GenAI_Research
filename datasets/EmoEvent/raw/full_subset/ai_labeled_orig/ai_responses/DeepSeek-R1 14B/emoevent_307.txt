Alright, so I need to figure out the emotion behind this tweet about the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire. Let me read it carefully: "It is secondary how #NotreDame could burn. The important thing is that a great cathedral of Christianity is for decades rather a place of pictures than a place of prayer." Hmm.

The user starts by saying it's secondary how the cathedral burned, implying they're not focusing on the fire itself but something else. Then they mention that what's more important is that this great Christian building has been a place for pictures (maybe tourism or aesthetics) rather than a place of genuine prayer for decades. 

So, the author seems to be expressing disappointment or sadness about the state of the cathedral as a religious institution. They're pointing out a disconnect between its purpose and what it's become—more of a tourist spot than a place for spiritual devotion. This sentiment reflects grief over the loss of meaning and perhaps a longing for the original purpose of the cathedral.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet isn't angry or fearful; it's more about lamenting the current state rather than expressing those emotions. It's not joyful either. Disgust could be a possibility if they're repelled by something, but I think it's more about sadness—feeling down because of the loss of what the cathedral represents.

So, the emotion conveyed here is likely **sadness**.

The tweet expresses disappointment and grief over the cathedral's diminished role as a place of worship. The emotion is **sadness**.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Let me read the tweet again carefully.

The tweet says, "It is secondary how #NotreDame could burn. The important thing is that a great cathedral of Christianity is for decades rather a place of pictures than a place of prayer." 

Hmm, the author starts by downplaying the burning itself as secondary, which suggests they aren't focusing on the event's tragedy but something else. They then talk about how Notre-Dame has been more a place of pictures (maybe meaning tourists taking photos) than a place for prayer.

This seems critical or disappointed with the state of the cathedral—implying that its purpose as a sacred space has diminished. So, they're expressing dissatisfaction about its current use. 

Looking at the emotion categories: anger is about annoyance or rage, which might fit if there's frustration. Disgust involves dislike or disinterest, but this seems more about disappointment rather than disgust. Sadness would be grief or pensiveness, which could also apply because of the loss, but the focus here is on critique.

I think the main emotion here is sadness, as it's a reflection on the state of something significant being lost or degraded. The author is expressing sorrow over the decline of the cathedral's spiritual importance.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet into one of the given emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The tweet is about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let me read it carefully.

The user says, "It is secondary how #NotreDame could burn." So they're downplaying the act of burning itself as not the main issue. Then they add, "The important thing is that a great cathedral of Christianity is for decades rather a place of pictures than a place of prayer." Hmm, so they're talking about the state of Notre Dame over time.

They're pointing out that the cathedral has been more focused on being a tourist spot (place of pictures) rather than a place for worship. So their main point isn't the fire itself but the state of the cathedral's purpose. The overall tone seems critical or disappointed about how the cathedral hasn't served its intended religious purpose.

Now, considering the emotions: anger is about irritation or rage; disgust is more about disliking something; fear is anxiety or terror; joy is positive feelings; sadness involves grief or pensiveness; surprise is about being amazed or distracted. 

The user seems to be expressing a sense of loss or disappointment about the cathedral's current state, which aligns with sadness. They're reflecting on how it hasn't fulfilled its role as a place for prayer but has been more of a tourist attraction. This reflects a feeling of grief or pensiveness about its misuse over time.

So, I think the emotion here is sadness.
