Okay, let's try to figure out the emotion behind this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. The user starts by mentioning that it's been over 24 hours and the media is moving on, but they want to remind people about the event. They describe the cathedral as an 800-year-old building and a huge beacon of hope for many people that burned down.

The first thing I notice is the use of words like "burned down," which immediately conveys destruction. The mention of it being an 800-year-old building adds weight to the significance of the loss. The author refers to it as a beacon of hope, suggesting it had great importance and positive meaning for many people.

The tone seems reflective and sorrowful, not angry or fearful. There's no expression of disgust or surprise; instead, there's a sense of lamentation. The hashtag usage also supports this sentiment, focusing on the tragedy rather than any other emotion.

So considering all these elements—sadness at the loss, reflection on the significance of the building—the emotion here is likely sadness.
