Alright, so I need to figure out the emotion in this tweet. Let me read it carefully.

The tweet says: "#ExtinctionRebellion = #youngpeople taking their future into their own hands...!!!! :) With some pretty incredible supporters behind them too!! Thank you #banksy #GretaThunberg for helping raise awareness around #climatechange USER https://t.co/OAV9R4hkNo"

First, I notice a lot of positive language. Words like "incredible," "thank you," and the smiley face :) all indicate happiness or support. The user is talking about young people taking action, which sounds inspiring.

They mention Extinction Rebellion, Banksy, and Greta Thunberg, who are known for their roles in environmental activism. This context suggests the tweet is about supporting a cause they believe in.

The exclamation marks and enthusiastic tone show excitement. Phrases like "taking their future into their own hands" imply empowerment and hope.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The options here are all positive except for maybe surprise, which isn't really applicable here because it's more about commendation.

The overall vibe is supportive and uplifting, so I'd classify this as joy.

Okay, so I need to classify the emotion of this tweet based on the given options: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me read the tweet again carefully.

The tweet says: "#ExtinctionRebellion = #youngpeople taking their future into their own hands...!!!! :) With some pretty incredible supporters behind them too!! Thank you #banksy #GretaThunberg for helping raise awareness around #climatechange USER https://t.co/OAV9R4hkNo"

Alright, breaking it down. The user is talking about Extinction Rebellion being young people taking charge of their future. They're using a lot of positive emojis (the smiley face with multiple exclamation points). Then they express gratitude towards Banksy and Greta Thunberg for raising awareness about climate change.

So the tone here seems upbeat and supportive. The mention of young people making a difference and having great supporters suggests encouragement and positivity. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or fear. Instead, it's all praise and thanks.

Looking at the emotion categories, joy fits because they're expressing happiness and support. No signs of surprise, which would require something unexpected. Sadness is also not present; everything seems positive. Disgust, fear, and anger aren't indicated either.

Therefore, the emotion conveyed here is definitely joy.

Hmm, the user is talking about Extinction Rebellion and young people taking charge. They mention that there are "incredible supporters" like Banksy and Greta Thunberg. The tweet ends with a smiley face and exclamation marks, which usually indicate positive emotions.

I should consider the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tone here seems positiveâ€”appreciation and support for the movement and its leaders. The use of "!!!!" and a smiley reinforces that it's a joyful sentiment. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or fear.

So I think the emotion conveyed is joy because they're expressing support and happiness about the efforts against climate change.
