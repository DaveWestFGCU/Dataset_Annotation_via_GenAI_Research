Okay, so I have this tweet to classify based on the emotion it conveys. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me break down the tweet step by step.

First, the tweet starts with "USER leave you tyrant." That's a strong statement directed at someone, using the word "tyrant," which is derogatory and shows contempt. So that immediately makes me think of anger because it's an accusation with harsh language.

Next, the author mentions Marxist ideology bringing "misery & death." This is a strong condemnation, indicating frustration or even rage towards the policies associated with socialism. The use of such intense words suggests more than just mild irritation; it points to anger.

Then there are hashtags like #venezuelalibre, #freedom, and #socialismkills. These reinforce the message against socialism and for freedom, which aligns with the anti-government sentiment. The tone here is critical and opposes the current regime, again pointing towards anger rather than other emotions like disgust or fear.

The tweet also says, "Here USER_S_Malema more proof your ideology is a failed one again." This is another direct accusation against someone (USER_S_Malema), likely referring to someone supporting Maduro. The use of "failed" implies disappointment but paired with the strong language earlier, it still leans towards anger.

The hashtags #SouthAfrican and #VoteCOPE are about political support in another country, possibly suggesting broader anti-socialist sentiment elsewhere. This adds context to the tweet's stance but doesn't change the emotion conveyed.

Putting it all together, the language is confrontational, uses strong words of accusation, and clearly opposes the current Venezuelan government. There's no indication of fear or surprise; instead, it's a direct expression of frustration and opposition, which falls under anger.

Okay, so I need to classify the emotion of this tweet regarding Venezuela's presidential crisis. Let me start by reading the tweet carefully.

The user wrote: "USER leave you tyrant. Your Marxist ideology has brought nothing but misery & death. The people of #Venezuela want #venezuelalibre #freedom for #socialismkills #EFF wake up. Here USER_S_Malema more proof your ideology is a failed one again. #SouthAfrican #VoteCOPE https://t.co/HqIKuXB0tN"

First, I notice the use of strong language like "tyrant," "misery & death," and hashtags like #socialismkills. These words are pretty intense and negative. The user is clearly upset with Nicolas Maduro's regime, referring to it as a failed ideology.

The tone here is confrontational. Phrases like "leave you tyrant" show frustration and anger. They're not just disagreeing; they're attacking the person or idea directly. Also, mentioning that Marxist ideology has caused harm suggests deep dislike or disgust.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger includes annoyance and rage, which fits because the user is clearly enraged by the situation. Disgust involves disliking something intensely, but in this case, the primary emotion seems to be more about anger towards a person ( Maduro) rather than disgust towards an action or thing.

There's no fear expressed here; instead, it's more about confronting the issue head-on. Joy and sadness aren't present either. Surprise isn't really applicable because the user is expressing a strong reaction that's been building up over time, not something sudden.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed is mainly anger towards what they perceive as Maduro's oppressive regime.

Alright, I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion it conveys. Let me look at the content carefully.

The user starts with "USER leave you tyrant." That's pretty harsh, showing a strong dislike or anger towards someone they're calling a tyrant. Then they mention Marxist ideology bringing misery and death. Those are strong negative words, indicating frustration or maybe even hate.

They also use hashtags like #venezuelalibre (free Venezuela), #freedom, #socialismkills, which suggests they're against the current regime and promoting change. Phrases like "wake up" imply urgency, possibly fear of continued harm if things don't change.

The mention of South African politics with #SouthAfrican and #VoteCOPE might be a call to action or showing solidarity elsewhere, but the main focus is on Venezuela's situation.

Overall, the emotions expressed seem to be anger and disgust. The user is attacking Maduro, using strong language, and pushing against his policies. There's no clear element of fear beyond the implied consequences, but the primary emotion is likely anger due to the direct criticism and harsh words.

The tweet expresses **anger** due to its strong language and criticism directed at a political figure.

**Answer:** **anger**
