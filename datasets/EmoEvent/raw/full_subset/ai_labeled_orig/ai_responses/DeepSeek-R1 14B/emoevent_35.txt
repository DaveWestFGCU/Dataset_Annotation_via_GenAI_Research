Alright, I'm trying to figure out the emotion behind this tweet. Let me read it again: "USER USER when did you guys start playing for the left?? Shutting down French officials on it possibly being terrorism #NotreDameCathedralFire. What a joke! But you let #ShepardSmith go on and on about collusion which didn’t happen. #cnn #fakenews".

First, the user is addressing someone as "USER USER," which seems a bit aggressive or annoyed. They're questioning when the other person started "playing for the left," implying they've taken a political stance. The mention of shutting down French officials regarding terrorism suggests frustration with how authorities are handling the Notre-Dame Cathedral Fire incident.

The phrase "What a joke!" clearly shows sarcasm and mockery, indicating disgust or disdain towards the situation or the coverage. They're also comparing it to letting Shepard Smith talk about collusion, which didn't happen, and tagging CNN and #fakenews. This implies frustration with media bias or misinformation.

Putting this together, the dominant emotion seems to be anger. The user is frustrated and annoyed, using sarcasm and criticism towards what they perceive as biased reporting by CNN. They're attacking both the handling of the fire incident and the media's focus on other issues.

Alright, I need to figure out which emotion the author of this tweet intended to convey based on the given options: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Looking at the tweet, the user is addressing someone as "USER USER," which seems a bit harsh. They mention shutting down French officials regarding the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire possibly being terrorism and describe it as "a joke." The use of "What a joke!" indicates sarcasm or mockery, which often conveys disgust.

Furthermore, the tweet criticizes media figures like Shepard Smith for talking about collusion that didn't happen, calling out CNN and labeling them as fake news. This critique shows frustration and disdain towards the media's coverage. Terms like "joke" and "fakenews" suggest a negative emotional tone, fitting into the disgust category.

There are no overt expressions of anger like direct accusations or threats, so while there's some frustration, it's more about disapproval rather than outright anger. Fear or surprise aren't evident because the tweet doesn't express worry or astonishment. Joy and sadness don't fit here either.

So, considering all these elements, the emotion conveyed is disgust.
