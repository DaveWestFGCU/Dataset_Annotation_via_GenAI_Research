Alright, let's break this down. The user provided a tweet that mentions World Book Day and talks about reading a book related to marine life. My task is to classify the emotion conveyed in this tweet from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

First, I'll look at the content of the tweet. It starts by describing the ocean as beautiful. That's a positive descriptor, which hints towards a positive emotion. Then it suggests reading a specific book for World Book Day and mentions that someone reviewed it. The tone seems encouraging and happy about reading and exploring new topics.

Now, considering the emotion categories: joy is associated with happiness, serenity, or ecstasy. Since the tweet is promoting reading and appreciating nature's beauty, it aligns well with joy. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger, disgust, fear, or sadness. Surprise isn't really applicable here because there's nothing unexpected mentioned.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed is joy.
