Alright, I'm looking at this tweet to determine the emotion behind it. The user mentions a great interview with Sir David King about climate change policy, tags include #extinctionrebellion and #GretaThunberg, and there's a link provided.

First, the word "Great" at the beginning immediately suggests a positive sentiment. Using words like "great" usually conveys satisfaction or approval. The mention of Sir David King is someone with significant authority in science and government, so the tweet is likely highlighting his expertise on climate change, which is a serious topic but approached here in an appreciative manner.

The use of hashtags #extinctionrebellion and #GretaThunberg indicates alignment with movements focused on environmental issues. These are typically associated with advocacy and positive actions towards climate change. The link provided probably leads to more information or the interview itself, which further underscores a commendable action rather than any negative emotion.

Considering the options: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Since the tweet starts with "Great," it's expressing approval or satisfaction, which falls under joy (including serenity and ecstasy). There's no indication of any other emotions like anger or sadness here. The tone is positive and encouraging.
