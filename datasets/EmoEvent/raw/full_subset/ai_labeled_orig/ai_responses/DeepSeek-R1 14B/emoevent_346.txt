Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the emotion behind this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the user is sharing images they took inside the cathedral ten years ago. They mention it was a "beautiful morning interior." That sounds positive and nostalgic. Then, they express hope that the cathedral will be fully restored to its former glory after the fire. 

The hashtags used are #NotreDame, #NotreDameCathedralFire, and #NotreDameInterior. These are all related to the event and the place, showing concern or interest in the situation.

Putting it together, the author is reflecting on happy memories of a beautiful place and expressing a desire for its restoration after a disaster. This seems more about hope and positivity rather than any negative emotion like anger or sadness. 

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tweet doesn't show anger or frustration, nor is there disgust. There's no clear fear or anxiety expressed, just a hopeful wish for restoration. While sadness might be an option because of the fire, the overall tone feels more positive and hopeful.

Therefore, the emotion conveyed here is likely **joy**, as it's tied to cherished memories and optimistic thoughts about the future.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet into one of the given emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Let me look at the tweet carefully.

The user mentions they took photos inside Notre Dame Cathedral ten years ago and that it was a beautiful morning. They express hope for the cathedral's full restoration after the fire. The tone here seems positive but also concerned about the aftermath of the fire. 

I don't see any signs of anger or disgust. There's no indication of fear either, since they're hoping for restoration rather than expressing fear. Joy isn't exactly it because while they enjoyed their visit, the tweet is more about loss and hope. Surprise doesn't fit because they're reflecting on a past experience and current event.

The main emotion seems to be sadness. They're looking back with fond memories and expressing a desire for something lost to be restored, which aligns with feelings of sadness or grief.

**sadness**

Alright, I need to figure out the emotion conveyed in this tweet about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Let me start by reading the tweet carefully.

The user shares a couple of images they took inside Notre-Dame ten years ago during their first visit to Paris. They describe it as a "beautiful morning interior." Then, they express hope that the cathedral will be fully restored to its former glory. The hashtags include #NotreDameCathedralFire, which ties it to the recent event.

So, the user is reflecting on past positive experiences and expressing a desire for restoration after a negative event—the fire. This seems to indicate sadness because they are looking back with fond memories and hoping for recovery, which can evoke feelings of loss or longing.

I should consider other emotions too. There's no anger expressed; it's more about the impact of the event rather than frustration. Disgust isn't present here—no negative feelings towards the cathedral itself. Fear? Not really, unless there's anxiety about the future, but that's not explicitly stated. Joy is absent because they're talking about a loss, though they remember a positive time. Surprise also doesn't fit because it's more about hope and reflection.

Therefore, sadness seems to be the most fitting emotion here.
