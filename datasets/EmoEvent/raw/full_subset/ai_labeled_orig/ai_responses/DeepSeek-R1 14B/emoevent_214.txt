Okay, let's see. I need to classify the emotion in this tweet about World Book Day. The user is asking for one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Looking at the tweet, it starts with "Happy #WorldBookDay" and includes a heart and book emojis. That already gives off a positive vibe. The author thanks various people involved in books, which shows gratitude and appreciation. Words like "thank you," "appreciate," and the warm closing with another heart emoji reinforce this positive sentiment.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, or surprise here. The tone is clearly upbeat and celebratory, fitting under joy. So, the emotion conveyed is joy.
