Alright, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to classify a tweet based on the emotion it conveys from a specific list of emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It mentions "Recommended Reading" followed by two users and their stories about changing approaches towards shared commons and addressing climate change. There are positive hashtags like #landrights and #GretaThunberg, which is associated with environmental activism. The link provided seems to be a resource or story that's being recommended.

Now, considering the emotions: The tweet doesn't express any negative feelings like anger or disgust. It doesn't seem fearful because it talks about "still have time," suggesting hope rather than fear. There's no indication of joy or serenity either; it's more informative than celebratory. Surprise isn't really there since it's a straightforward recommendation.

That leaves us with sadness, but I don't detect any sad tone here. The message is more about sharing information and promoting action, which might lean towards hope or optimism, but that's not one of the options provided. Since the user specified to choose from the given list, and there's no clear fit for joy or fear, maybe it's none of them, but perhaps the closest would be joy if we consider it as a positive message.

Wait, actually, looking again, the tweet isn't expressing an emotion itself; it's just sharing information. So, maybe it doesn't convey any emotion strongly. But I have to choose one from the list. Given that, I might lean towards sadness because climate change is a serious issue, but the tone here seems more neutral or informative rather than sad.

Hmm, perhaps I should reconsider. The user included Greta Thunberg, who's associated with activism and urgency, which could imply some underlying concern, pointing towards fear. But the tweet itself doesn't express that emotion explicitly; it's just a recommendation.

I think the best fit might be 'sadness' because climate change is often linked with gloomy statistics, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, since the tweet is encouraging action, maybe it's more about hope, which isn't an option here. Therefore, perhaps none of the emotions fit perfectly, but among the options, 'sadness' might be closest.

Alright, so I need to classify this tweet by the emotion it conveys. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Looking at the tweet: It's recommending a reading about how we still have time to change our approach towards shared commons and address climate change. It mentions Greta Thunberg as well.

The tone seems positive because it suggests there's still hope and time to make changes. The mention of recommended reading and actionable steps implies an optimistic view, which aligns with joy or serenity. There are no negative emotions expressed here.

Alright, I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion it conveys. Let me read through it carefully.

The tweet starts with a recommendation: "Recommended Reading" followed by authors USER_Rabley and Kirk Talbot in their book "USER_Stories". The content is about changing our approach towards shared commons and addressing the looming crisis of #climatechange. There's also a link to Greta Thunberg, who's known for her climate activism.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

The tweet isn't expressing any negative emotions like anger or disgust. It doesn't seem fearful either; instead, it's suggesting reading material which implies an informative tone. There's no clear indication of joy or serenity here. Sadness might be associated with climate issues, but the tweet is more about suggesting action through reading. Surprise isn't present either.

So, considering all this, the emotion conveyed seems to be sadness because the topic is about a serious issue like climate change, which naturally evokes a sense of sorrow or concern.
</think>

**sadness**

The tweet discusses climate change and suggests reading material on the subject, which conveys a sense of seriousness and concern rather than any other specific emotion.
