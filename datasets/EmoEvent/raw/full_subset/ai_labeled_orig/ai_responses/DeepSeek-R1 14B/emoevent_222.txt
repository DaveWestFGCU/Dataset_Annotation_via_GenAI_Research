Alright, I need to figure out which emotion this tweet is conveying. The user provided a list of emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

The tweet says: "Henderson getting bitched by that Rat üêÄ Alba #ChampionsLeague #BarcaLiverpool"

First, let's break down the words. "Bitched" usually means criticizing or being harshly spoken to, often in a derogatory way. The word "Rat" with an emoji of a rat üêÄ is likely a slang term for criticism or a putdown.

"Henderson" refers to a person, probably a football player from Liverpool since the hashtags are #ChampionsLeague and #BarcaLiverpool, so Barcelona vs Liverpool context.

Alba is another player, maybe Ivan Rakitiƒá, who sometimes uses criticism towards teammates. So Henderson is being criticized by Alba here.

The emotion here seems negative. Let's consider the options:

- Anger: If someone is criticizing harshly, that could be anger or frustration.
- Disgust: Maybe if it's about disliking the behavior, but "bitched" sounds more like criticism than disgust.
- Fear: Doesn't seem applicable here; no indication of fear.
- Joy: Definitely not; this is a negative interaction.
- Sadness: Could be if someone feels down, but the tweet seems more about frustration.
- Surprise: Not really, unless it's unexpected, but "getting bitched" sounds like a known issue.

The word "bitching" can imply being yelled at or scolded. So the emotion is likely anger because Henderson is being harshly criticized by Alba during the game. The use of "rat" might be slang for criticizing someone in a negative way, which adds to the frustration or irritation.

So the emotion conveyed here is probably anger.

The tweet expresses frustration and irritation due to criticism, fitting under anger.

Okay, so I need to classify this tweet's emotion. The tweet says: "Henderson getting bitched by that Rat üêÄ Alba #ChampionsLeague #BarcaLiverpool". Let me break it down.

First, the mention of Henderson and Alba. From what I know, Henderson is a Liverpool player and Alba is a Barcelona player. They were part of the 2019 Champions League final where Barcelona won against Liverpool in controversial circumstances, especially with the handball incident involving Sergio Busquets which many considered harsh.

The tweet uses "getting bitched," which means being criticized harshly or unfairly. The word "bitch" can carry a negative connotation, implying that Henderson is being spoken down to or treated roughly by Alba. Also, the use of "Rat üêÄ" as an emoji adds to this‚Äîmaybe suggesting that Alba acted like a rat, which could imply betrayal or underhandedness.

The hashtags are #ChampionsLeague and #BarcaLiverpool, pointing to the 2019 final. So, the author is likely referring back to that game where Liverpool felt aggrieved by Barcelona's tactics or decisions made during the match.

Considering all this, the emotion here seems to be frustration or anger towards how Alba treated Henderson, possibly about the controversial decisions in the Champions League final. The choice of words and emojis lean towards expressing annoyances orrage, not just any negative feeling but specifically anger.

Alright, let's break down this tweet to figure out the emotion behind it. The tweet says: "Henderson getting bitched by that Rat üêÄ Alba #ChampionsLeague #BarcaLiverpool".

First, I notice the mention of Henderson and Alba, who are likely football players from Barcelona and Liverpool, given the hashtags #ChampionsLeague, #Barca, and #Liverpool. The word "bitching" here is being used in a negative context, probably referring to criticism or harsh comments directed at Henderson by Alba.

The use of the word "Rat üêÄ Alba" adds some insult. Rat emojis are often used as a derogatory term towards someone, implying they're acting negatively or spitefully. So, Alba is being called a rat, which is a sign of disrespect and dislike.

Putting it together, the author is expressing negative feelings towards Alba's behavior towards Henderson. The tone seems sarcastic and‰∏çÊª° (dissatisfied), showing that the author doesn't like what Alba did or said. 

Looking at the emotion categories: anger involves annoyance or rage; disgust includes disinterest or dislike. Here, the author is clearly showing a dislike towards Alba's actions, so "disgust" seems to fit better than "anger", even though there might be elements of both.

Therefore, the most relevant emotion here is disgust because it captures the dislike and aversion expressed in the tweet.
