Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this tweet's emotion. The tweet is about using neuroscience to increase youth participation in campaigns, and it mentions a brilliant article by the user on the science behind socially conscious youths. It also tags Greta Thunberg and David Hogg.

First, I need to look at the words used. Words like "utilise," "brilliant," "science behind," and "socially conscious" sound positive. The author is highlighting an article that seems insightful and relevant. They're expressing approval by calling it brilliant, which conveys a positive emotion.

I should consider the context too. Greta Thunberg and David Hogg are known for their activism and have inspired youth movements. The tweet is encouraging others to engage in social change through neuroscience insights, so it's likely aiming to inspire or motivate people positively.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The tone here isn't negative; there's no sign of any negative feelings like frustration or disappointment. It's more about celebrating an idea or a piece of work that's seen as beneficial for social change.

The use of emojis, like the brain emoji ðŸ§ , adds to the celebratory and positive vibe. Thereâ€™s also excitement in promoting the article and the cause. The author seems enthusiastic about the topic and the user's contribution.

So, putting it all together, the emotion here is joy because the tweet expresses positivity, approval, and enthusiasm about a good idea or achievement.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to classify a tweet based on the emotion conveyed by the author. I need to choose from the given list: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully:

"How can we utilise neuroscience to increase youth participation in campaignsðŸ§ ? Brilliant article by our own USER, looking into the science behind what's driving the socially conscious youths of today. https://t.co/ndlcSSZo1n  #SocialChange #GretaThunberg #DavidHogg"

Breaking it down:

The tweet starts with a question about using neuroscience to boost youth participation in campaigns. The author mentions a "brilliant article" by their own user, highlighting the science behind socially conscious youths.

Key words and phrases:
- "Brilliant article" â€“ indicates praise or admiration.
- "Looking into the science behind what's driving..." â€“ shows interest and appreciation for the depth of the topic.
- The use of emojis like ðŸ§  (brain) adds a positive, engaging tone.

The hashtags also include #GretaThunberg and #DavidHogg, both figures associated with youth activism. This context suggests the tweet is supportive and encouraging towards such movements.

The overall tone seems enthusiastic and complimentary. There's no indication of negative emotions like anger or disgust. The focus is on admiration for the article and its subject matter.

So, considering all this, the emotion conveyed here is joy. It's not just about happiness but also includes serenity and positive feelings associated with appreciating good work.

Okay, I need to classify this tweet based on the emotion it conveys. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Looking at the tweet: "How can we utilise neuroscience to increase youth participation in campaignsðŸ§ ? Brilliant article by our own USER, looking into the science behind what's driving the socially conscious youths of today." There's a link and some hashtags too.

The author is talking about using neuroscience for youth engagement. They mention an article written by "USER" (maybe themselves?) as brilliant. The words like "Brilliant" are positive, so that suggests joy or maybe surprise.

They also reference Greta Thunberg, who's known for her climate activism, and David Hogg, a survivor of the Parkland shooting and gun control advocate. These topics are about social change but don't inherently carry strong emotions like anger or fear in this context.

The tone is encouraging and appreciative, using words like "brilliant" which indicates enthusiasmâ€”so joy seems right. There's no sign of sadness, surprise isn't really captured here since it's more about praise than unexpected news.
