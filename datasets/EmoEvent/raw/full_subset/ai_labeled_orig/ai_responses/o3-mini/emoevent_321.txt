Response 1:
Important points to consider:
• The tweet highlights the tragic, “devastating” Notre Dame fire, a deeply saddening event.
• The incongruous “#thankful” appears to be used sarcastically, hinting at a dark humor response to the tragedy.
• Despite the irony, the overall context of loss and tragedy suggests that the underlying emotional tone is one of sorrow.

**sadness**

Response 2:
Important points to consider:
• The word “devastating” points to a tragic event.
• The hashtag “#thankful” used immediately after creates a jarring, ironic contrast that suggests insincerity.
• This ironic juxtaposition of tragedy and gratitude likely aims to criticize or mock the situation rather than express genuine thanks.
• Such sarcastic, biting tone is commonly associated with anger and annoyance.

**anger**

Important points to consider:
• The tweet uses the adjective “devastating” when describing the Notre Dame fire, a term that typically evokes sorrow or gravitas.
• The follow‐up “we are so #thankful this is happening” creates an unexpected, almost ironic twist by juxtaposing gratitude with a tragic event.
• This stark contrast creates a sense of incongruity that surprises the reader.

**surprise**
