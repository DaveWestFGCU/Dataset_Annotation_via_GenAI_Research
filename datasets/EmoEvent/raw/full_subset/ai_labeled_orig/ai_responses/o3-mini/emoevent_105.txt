Record: "A monument to human creation/achievement has been lost. That it's been used as a house of worship is irrelevant. That some in our community are behaving as reactionary tribalists shouldn't guide our response. Condolences. #NotreDame #NotreDameCathedralFire #NotreDameCathedral https://t.co/ZyrlwFNXOR"
