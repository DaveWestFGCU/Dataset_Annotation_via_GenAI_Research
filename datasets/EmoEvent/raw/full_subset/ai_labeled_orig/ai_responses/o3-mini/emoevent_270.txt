Record: "Thrilling to see Venezuelans rise from the oppression of Socialism. Freedom is the natural condition of mankind. If it is not given by government it will be demanded by the people. By sword, if necessary. Patriots in America are with you, #Venezuela https://t.co/sTudUp1H1L"

Response 3:
• The tweet praises the uprising against what is described as an oppressive regime, using charged, militant language (e.g., "By sword, if necessary") which heightens the intensity of the call for resistance.  
• It expresses excitement ("Thrilling to see") over this collective act of defiance, but the description of oppression and the willingness to use force suggest a deep, righteous anger at the current system.  
• The overall tone is combative and confrontational, rallying support for a violent overthrow if needed, thereby emphasizing anger rather than simple joy.
