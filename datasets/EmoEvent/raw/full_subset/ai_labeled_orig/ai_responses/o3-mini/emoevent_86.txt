Response 3:
Important points: The tweet humorously exaggerates a long-standing, irrational fear (of zombies) and uses playful language and an emoji to emphasize a comical, yet underlying sense of apprehension. The focus on a fearâ€”even expressed with humorâ€”suggests the intended emotion is primarily about anxiety or terror related to the topic. **fear**
