Record: "It is secondary how #NotreDame could burn. The important thing is that a great cathedral of Christianity is for decades rather a place of pictures than a place of prayer. #CathedraleNotreDame  #CathedraleNotreDamedeParis  #NotreDameCathedralFire  #NotreDameCathedral"

Response 1:
Important points to consider:
- The tweet downplays the catastrophe by saying how the fire happened is "secondary."
- The emphasis is on a longstanding issue: the cathedral’s transformation into a mere tourist attraction ("a place of pictures") rather than maintaining its sacred role as a place of prayer.
- This critique implies strong disapproval and frustration regarding a shift away from the cathedral’s religious purpose.
