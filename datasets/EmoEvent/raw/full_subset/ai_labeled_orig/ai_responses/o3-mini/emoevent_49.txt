Response 1:
Important points to consider:
• The tweet is reporting a statement broadcast on BBCpapers regarding the U.S. allegedly orchestrating a change in leadership in Venezuela.
• It presents a political claim about external influence during a contested crisis, but does so in a neutrally informative manner.
• There is no overt use of emotionally charged language such as words that indicate anger, disgust, or fear.
• The phrasing “engineer a peaceful transition” might be seen as unexpected or striking, which can evoke a sense of surprise in the reader.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:
• The tweet relays a quote stating that “The US is trying to engineer a peaceful transition.”
• It is presented as a factual report of a statement from a news source, without overtly charged language.
• While the phrase “engineer a peaceful transition” could be read skeptically, the tweet itself does not include strong emotional cues like anger or fear.
• Given the neutral, yet attention-catching nature of the statement, the most relevant emotional tone seems to lean toward being surprised by the notion.

**surprise**

Response 3:
Important points:
• The tweet quotes a source stating “The US is trying to engineer a peaceful transition,” directly referencing US involvement in Venezuelan politics.
• The phrasing “engineer” suggests an active, manipulative effort, which can imply discontent or criticism.
• While the overall tone is informational, the choice of language points to a subtle criticism likely intended to evoke a sense of protest or opposition.
