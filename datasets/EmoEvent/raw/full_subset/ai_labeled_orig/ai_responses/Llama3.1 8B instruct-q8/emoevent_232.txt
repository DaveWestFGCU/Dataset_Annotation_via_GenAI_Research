Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet is unrelated to the Notre Dame Cathedral Fire.
* The text is an advertisement for Mother's Day products.
* There are hashtags such as "#NotreDameCathedralFire" which suggests the author may be attempting to associate their product with a current event.

Given these points, the author's intended emotion appears to be **joy**, as they are promoting a product and using language that is enthusiastic and promotional.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet is not related to the Notre Dame Cathedral Fire, which is mentioned in a separate context.
* The tweet appears to be a promotional message for Mother's Day products.
* The mention of #NotreDameCathedralFire seems out of place and unrelated to the rest of the content.

Given these points, it's likely that the author intended to convey **surprise** or perhaps even **disgust** due to the jarring juxtaposition of a serious event (the fire) with a seemingly frivolous advertisement. However, considering the tone of the tweet is more promotional than critical, **surprise** is a more fitting choice.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet is unrelated to the Notre Dame Cathedral Fire.
* The primary focus of the tweet is a promotional message about Mother's Day gifts.
* The hashtags at the end include the Notre Dame Cathedral Fire, but it appears to be a non-sequitur.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is not directly related to the Notre Dame Cathedral Fire. However, considering the tone of the tweet as a whole:

**joy**

The author is promoting Mother's Day gifts and seems enthusiastic about their products, indicating a joyful or positive tone. The mention of the Notre Dame Cathedral Fire in the hashtags may be included for added relevance or attention-grabbing purposes, but it does not seem to contribute to the overall emotional tone of the tweet.
