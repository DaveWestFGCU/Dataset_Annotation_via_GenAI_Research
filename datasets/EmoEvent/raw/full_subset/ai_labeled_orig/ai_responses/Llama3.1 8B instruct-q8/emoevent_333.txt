Important points to consider:

* The tweet mentions that the uprising in Venezuela is "failing", which suggests a negative outcome or development.
* The tone of the tweet appears to be informative rather than emotive, as it simply states a fact without expressing personal opinion.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label for this tweet is **anger**, as the failure of the uprising may be perceived as a negative outcome that could elicit anger from supporters of Juan Guaido.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author mentions that the uprising (or rebellion) in Venezuela is "failing", implying a negative outcome.
* The tone of the statement suggests a sense of defeat or disappointment.

**anger**

Reasoning: While the tone could also be interpreted as simply neutral or factual, the use of "failing" implies a sense of frustration or disappointment, which can be related to anger. However, it's worth noting that this classification is not definitive and another emotion (e.g., sadness) might also be argued for, depending on the author's intentions.
