Response 3:
Here are the important points to consider given the text:

* The author is responding to a news event (the Notre Dame Cathedral fire) with a reflective and philosophical tone.
* They express appreciation for heritage sites ("Happy we value our heritage sites") and highlight interconnectedness between values, people, and the planet.
* There is no direct mention of the fire or its impact on emotions such as sadness, fear, or anger.

Given these points, the author's intended emotion can be inferred to be a sense of concern for the bigger picture and the importance of valuing all aspects of life, rather than reacting directly to the immediate news event. 

The most relevant emotion label is **sadness**, but in this context, it's more about a sense of long-term loss or decline ("Otherwise it all collapses, fades to black") rather than a direct response to the fire.
