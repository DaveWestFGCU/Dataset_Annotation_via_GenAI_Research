Record: "I feel like I'm saying this every week but am I the only one who thought #GameofThrones was actually really poor this week?   Awfully shot and full of flimsy logic with a massively bloated runtime as well. This season is shaping up worse than the last one, big disappointment."

Response 3:
Here are some important points to consider:

* The author is expressing dissatisfaction with the current season of Game of Thrones.
* They mention specific criticisms such as poor cinematography and plot logic issues.
* The tone is negative and disappointed.

Given these points, I would classify the tweet as **disgust**. The author's criticism is strong, but it doesn't seem to be driven by anger or fear. They don't sound surprised or joyful about the show's performance. The tone is more one of disappointment and distaste for what they perceive as a subpar product.
