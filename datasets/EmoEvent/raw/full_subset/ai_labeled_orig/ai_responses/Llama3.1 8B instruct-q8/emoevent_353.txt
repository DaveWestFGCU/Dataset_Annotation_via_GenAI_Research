Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is expressing a strong opinion about the English Premier League being the best league in the world.
* The use of "Righto!!" and the raised eyebrow emoji (ðŸ™„) suggests that the author is being slightly sarcastic or tongue-in-cheek.
* The hashtags "#barcalfc #ChampionsLeague" suggest that the author has a particular allegiance to Barcelona FC and/or the Champions League, but this does not necessarily indicate emotion.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**surprise**
 
This is because the author's tone appears to be slightly sarcastic or ironic, as if they are poking fun at the idea that the English Premier League is widely considered the best league in the world. The use of "Righto!!" and the raised eyebrow emoji (ðŸ™„) suggests a sense of surprise or disbelief at this notion.

Important points to consider:

* The tone of the tweet is informal and sarcastic.
