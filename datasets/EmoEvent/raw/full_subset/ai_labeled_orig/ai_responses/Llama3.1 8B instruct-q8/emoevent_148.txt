* The author mentions hoping for the defeat of a political party (VOX).
* The tone is expressed through the word "hopefully", which implies a desire or wish.

Response 2:
Here are the important points to consider:

* The tweet mentions "hopefully", which suggests a positive outcome is desired.
* The outcome of interest (VOX's defeat) implies that the author disapproves of VOX or its platform.
* The tone is informal and conversational, suggesting the author's personal opinion.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**sadness**

The author likely wants VOX to lose because they disagree with their views, but this desire may also stem from a sense of concern or fear for what VOX represents. However, since sadness is more closely related to disappointment and hopelessness (which are implied in "hopefully"), it's the most fitting label among the options provided.
