Important points to consider:

* The author starts by agreeing with someone, which suggests a temporary truce or concession.
* However, they immediately follow it up with criticism and a strong negative statement about a person (the "orange Putin puppet" in the White House).
* The tone is confrontational, using phrases like "I will never forgive".
* The language used to describe the person (e.g. "obeisance", "puppet") implies contempt or disdain.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**anger**

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The author expresses agreement with someone else's opinion, which suggests a neutral or positive tone at the beginning.
* However, they immediately turn against the person they agree with by calling them an "obedience" to someone they dislike ("orange Putin puppet").
* The language used is strong and critical, implying a negative emotion.
* The author demands that someone (likely Trump) leaves Venezuela alone.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**. The author's tone shifts from agreement to criticism and demands action, which suggests anger towards the person being addressed and the subject of their criticism.
