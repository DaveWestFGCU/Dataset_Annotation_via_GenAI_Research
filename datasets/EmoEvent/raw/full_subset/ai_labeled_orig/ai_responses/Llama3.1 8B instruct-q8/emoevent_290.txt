Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is comparing two popular TV shows (#AvengersEndgame and #GameOfThrones).
* The author mentions a specific scene from Game of Thrones, the Battle of Winterfell, which was highly acclaimed.
* The tone appears to be casual and informal, with the use of "'Arya'" as a standalone statement.

Given these points, it seems that the author is expressing enthusiasm and admiration for Game of Thrones, particularly for the character Arya. Therefore:

**joy**

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet is a comparison between two popular TV shows and movies.
* The author mentions that Avengers: Endgame was "great" but then immediately dismisses it in favor of Game of Thrones' Battle of Winterfell, using the name of a beloved character (Arya) as a reason.
* The tone seems to be lighthearted and casual.

Given these points, I would classify the tweet as:

**joy**

The author's use of the word "great" suggests that they enjoyed Avengers: Endgame, but their enthusiasm is quickly eclipsed by their love for Game of Thrones, which implies a sense of joy or pleasure in expressing their preference.

Given these points, the tweet appears to be expressing **joy**, as the author seems to be enthusiastic and excited about Game of Thrones, particularly Arya.
