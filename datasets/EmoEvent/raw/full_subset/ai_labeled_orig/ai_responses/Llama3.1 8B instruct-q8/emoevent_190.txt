Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet appears to be expressing a positive opinion about an event or situation.
* The use of "WELL DONE" suggests approval and appreciation.
* The mention of the "DEEPSTATE" and TRUMP in a negative light implies that the author is on the opposing side of the conflict.

Given these points, it's likely that the author intended to convey **joy**, as they seem to be expressing approval and celebration towards an event or outcome.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet appears to be expressing support for a specific outcome (coup in Venezuela) rather than criticizing or condemning it.
* The tone is celebratory, using phrases like "WELL DONE GUYS" and an enthusiastic reaction to the event.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**joy**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet contains phrases that can be interpreted as sarcastic or ironic, such as "WELL DONE GUYS".
* The author uses all caps for emphasis, which can convey strong emotions.
* The mention of a "coup" and the involvement of powerful entities like the Deep State and Trump suggests a sense of seriousness and possibly outrage.

However, given the use of sarcasm and irony in the phrase "WELL DONE GUYS", it's likely that the author is expressing **anger**.
