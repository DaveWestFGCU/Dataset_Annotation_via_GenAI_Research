Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet mentions a fire at Notre-Dame Cathedral, which is a tragic and devastating event.
* The author also mentions "Got Money For War But Can't Feed The Poor", which suggests that the issue of wealth distribution is on their mind.
* The hashtags suggest that the author is also discussing politics and current events.

Given these points, it seems likely that the author's emotions are related to criticism or disapproval of societal issues rather than a direct emotional response to the fire itself. Therefore, the most relevant emotion label is:

**anger**

The tweet suggests that the author is frustrated with the priorities of society, as evidenced by the fact that money is being allocated for war but not for basic needs like feeding the poor. This indicates a strong sense of disapproval and frustration, which falls under the category of anger.
