Response 1:
Here are the important points to consider:

* The tweet uses strong language to condemn a person's behavior.
* The behavior being condemned involves spreading conspiracy theories, which can be seen as misleading or false information.
* The tone of the tweet is critical and disapproving.

Given these considerations, the emotion label that best fits this tweet is:

**disgust**

This classification makes sense because the author finds the person's behavior to be morally reprehensible and unpleasant. The use of the word "absolutely disgusting" reinforces this interpretation.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author uses strong language ("absolutely disgusting") to express their sentiment.
* The phrase "#FearMonger" suggests that the author views the person as spreading unfounded or excessive fear, rather than experiencing fear themselves.
* The tone is critical and dismissive towards the interviewee.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **disgust**.
