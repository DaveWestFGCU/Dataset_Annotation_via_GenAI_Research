Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet mentions a donation of $5 million
* The tone is informal and thankful, as indicated by the phrase "Thank you"

Given these points, the author's intended emotion seems to be appreciation or gratitude. However, since this option is not explicitly listed in the provided choices, I will select the closest match:

**joy**

While joy might seem like an unusual choice for a tweet about a devastating fire and rebuilding efforts, it's possible that the author is expressing happiness and positivity about someone contributing to the cause of rebuilding the cathedral.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet is a response to the Notre Dame Cathedral fire.
* The tone of the tweet appears sarcastic, with the user expressing gratitude for a donation that seems excessive and out of place given the context of a devastating fire.
* The hashtag #NotreDameCathedralFire suggests that the author is commenting on the event.

Given these points, it's likely that the author intended to convey:

**anger**
The sarcastic tone and implication that the donation is unwarranted suggest a negative emotional response, which aligns with the category of anger.
