Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The text expresses a strong emotional reaction to a character's death.
* The use of profanity ("fuck") indicates intensity and possibly frustration or shock.
* The phrasing "#GameOfThrons" suggests that the author is expressing their opinion about the show.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is: **anger**.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response 2:
Here are the points to consider:

* The language used is strong and impolite ("fuck").
* The author expresses a personal emotional response to a specific event (Theon's death).
* The tone appears to be intense.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**anger**

Note that while "disgust" could also be considered due to the use of profanity, the context suggests that the author is reacting with strong negative emotions towards a dramatic event rather than expressing disgust or disinterest.
