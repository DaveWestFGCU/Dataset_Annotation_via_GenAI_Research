Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is commenting on a specific person (Greta Thunberg) and an event (climate change)
* The use of "No shoe" suggests disapproval or criticism
* The hashtags suggest the author's geographical location (Leitrim, Ireland) and affiliations (#sligoleitrimgreens, #geai, etc.)

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**anger**

The tone of the tweet comes across as critical and dismissive, with the author expressing annoyance or frustration towards Greta Thunberg. The use of "too arrogant" further suggests that the author is angry at Thunberg's perceived attitude or behavior.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet appears to be a response to Greta Thunberg, who is known for her climate activism.
* The author uses an exclamation mark and the phrase "No shoe" which seems out of place in a typical conversation about climate change.
* The hashtags suggest that the author is from Leitrim or involved with local groups there.

Given these points, it's likely that the tweet is expressing annoyance or irritation with Greta Thunberg, rather than genuine interest in her message. However, the tone is more dismissive and frustrated than enraged, so:

**anger**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
