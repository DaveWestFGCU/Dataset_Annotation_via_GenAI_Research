Here are the important points to consider:

* The tweet mentions "all these super rich donations" which implies that the author is highlighting a perceived discrepancy in how wealthy individuals respond to different crises.
* The text "So why can’t they do something new & revolutionary???" suggests frustration and disappointment with the current state of affairs.
* The hashtags #NotreDameCathedralFire, #elite, #revolutionary, #neworder, #changes, and #HumanityFirst indicate that the author is using this opportunity to comment on broader social issues.

Given these points, the tweet appears to convey **anger**, as it expresses frustration and annoyance at the perceived hypocrisy of wealthy individuals.

* The tone is one of frustration and incredulity.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:
