Record: "I'm generally really against spoilers - I can't hear a tiny detail without my brain immediately extrapolating everything around it - but still, the race to catch up on stuff before someone well-meaning 'thinks' they're not spoiling something is REALLY STRESSFUL... #GameofThrones"

Response 1:
Here are the important points to consider:

* The author expresses frustration and stress related to spoilers
* They mention a specific behavior (hearing tiny details leading to overthinking) that exacerbates their distress
* The tone is one of exasperation, emphasizing how stressful the situation has become

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is: **frustration/anger**. However, since "anger" is the closest match among the options, I will choose:

**anger**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author mentions being "really against spoilers", indicating a strong sentiment.
* They express frustration with the situation, using the phrase "REALLY STRESSFUL".
* However, they also mention that despite their opposition to spoilers, they can't help but be stressed about catching up on content.

Based on these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**anger**

Note: The author's tone suggests a sense of frustration and annoyance rather than outright anger, but since "anger" includes "annoyance", it is the most fitting category.

Response 3:
Here are the important points to consider:

* The author expresses a negative sentiment towards spoilers and the pressure of keeping up with them.
* The use of "STRESSFUL" in all capital letters emphasizes the intensity of their feeling.
* The tone is cautionary, warning others about the consequences of hearing even small details.

Based on these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**frustration/sadness are not explicitly listed but I chose to select a broader category that encompasses it. Given the options, the closest match would be **sadness**, as it encompasses pensiveness and grief (although frustration is more fitting), however since frustration isn't an option, sadness is the chosen one here)
