Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The language used is aggressive and derogatory, with repeated use of profanity.
* The tone is confrontational and critical.
* The author appears to be addressing individuals who are not taking action on climate change.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**anger**

Note: While "fear" could also be a plausible option, given the context and language used, it seems more likely that the author is expressing anger at those who are not taking action on climate change.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author is addressing someone they perceive as ignorant or uninformed about climate change.
* The use of profanity and derogatory language ("don't be a fucking idiot", "udumass") suggests a strong negative emotional tone.
* The author is urging the person to take action and support the cause.

Given these points, I would classify the tweet as **anger**, as it conveys frustration, annoyance, and indignation towards someone who is not taking climate change seriously.
