Record: "Another #GameofThrones complaint: the battle for the throne is supposed to be a subplot in relation to the ultimate clash between ice and fire, and should have been redefined not only politically but metaphysically by the larger demand that all ally against the Dead."

Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is discussing a criticism of Game of Thrones.
* The tone appears to be analytical and concerned with the show's narrative choices.
* The language used is formal and focused on the plot.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**. The author is expressing frustration and disappointment with the way the storyline was handled, indicating a sense of anger or annoyance.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The author mentions a "complaint", suggesting they are expressing dissatisfaction with the show.
* They reference a specific plot point (the battle for the throne) and suggest it was mishandled.
* The tone seems critical and analytical, rather than emotive or reactive.

Given these points, the author's intention is to express criticism and disappointment, which is closest to **sadness**, as they seem to be lamenting a perceived misstep in the show's plot.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The author is discussing their complaint about the TV series Game of Thrones.
* The tone appears to be critical and analytical rather than emotional or reactive.
* The author mentions a specific plot point (the battle for the throne) and how it should have been handled differently.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**sadness**
 
This might seem counterintuitive at first, but the author's complaint about the show suggests that they were invested in its storyline and had certain expectations. Their disappointment with the plot twist is likely to evoke a sense of sadness or frustration, rather than anger, disgust, fear, joy, or surprise.
