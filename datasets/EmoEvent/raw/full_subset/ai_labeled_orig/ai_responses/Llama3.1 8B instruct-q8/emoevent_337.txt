Response 2:
To classify the tweet, let's consider the following points:

* The user expresses affection and admiration for George Takei ("Have I mentioned how much I love you?").
* They mention a specific news event, the Notre Dame Cathedral Fire, but in relation to praising someone else.
* There is no apparent connection between George Takei and the cathedral fire.

Given these considerations, it appears that the user's intention is to express enthusiasm and admiration for George Takei, rather than any emotion related directly to the cathedral fire. 

Therefore, **joy** is the most relevant label, as the user seems to be experiencing a positive emotional state when expressing their affection and appreciation for George Takei.
