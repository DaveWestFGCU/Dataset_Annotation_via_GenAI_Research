Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet is about a character's illness or discomfort ("I don't feel so good")
* There are no obvious indicators of strong emotions such as anger, fear, or joy
* The tone seems more neutral and concerned rather than happy or excited
* The hashtags suggest the author is discussing Game of Thrones in a casual manner

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**sadness**
 
The tweet's tone is more somber and concerned for Arya Stark's well-being, which aligns with sadness.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet is referencing a scene from the TV show Game of Thrones.
* The quote suggests that someone (likely a character) is experiencing physical discomfort or illness.
* The hashtags are related to the show and its characters, indicating a fan engagement.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is: **sadness**

This classification is based on the fact that the tweet appears to be referencing a dramatic or intense moment in the show, which might elicit an emotional response from fans. The use of a quote and hashtags suggests that the author is reacting to the scene with a sense of empathy or concern for the character's well-being, which aligns with the emotion of sadness.

Response 3:
Here are the important points to consider:

* The text appears to be a quote from a scene in Game of Thrones.
* The tone is likely informal and conversational, as it's written in a casual style (e.g. "Uh" at the beginning).
* There is no apparent criticism or negative commentary about the show.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**surprise**
The quote suggests that something unexpected is happening, and Arya Stark seems to be reacting with surprise or alarm. The use of an exclamation mark after "Uh" also implies a sense of suddenness or unexpectedness.
