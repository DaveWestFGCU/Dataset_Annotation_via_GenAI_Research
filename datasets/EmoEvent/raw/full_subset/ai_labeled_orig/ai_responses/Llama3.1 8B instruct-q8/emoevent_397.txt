Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet mentions conspiracy theories about the cause of the fire, which suggests a biased and accusatory tone.
* The author appears to be pointing out what they perceive as hypocrisy or double standards in how different groups are labeled or blamed for actions.
* The use of hashtags and specific labels like "Looney Left" implies that the author is trying to elicit an emotional response from their audience.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**anger**

The author's tone suggests a sense of indignation and outrage towards what they see as unfair or hypocritical treatment of certain groups. The use of pejorative labels like "Looney Left" and the implication that the media is covering up the truth also contribute to an overall sense of anger.
