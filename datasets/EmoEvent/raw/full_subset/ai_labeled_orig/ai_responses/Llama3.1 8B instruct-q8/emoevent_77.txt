Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet mentions the Notre-Dame Cathedral Fire, which is a serious and tragic event.
* The author is grateful to passengers for sharing their stories related to the fire.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **sadness**, as the event being referred to (the fire) is a tragic occurrence.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet mentions a specific event, the Notre-Dame Cathedral Fire.
* The author is expressing gratitude towards users who shared their stories about this event.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **gratitude** or more specifically in this context, joy. However, since "joy" is the only available option that can be inferred from the tweet and considering the context of sharing stories after a tragic event, I would choose:

* **joy**

Note: While it might seem unusual to associate joy with a story about a fire, in this context, the author is expressing appreciation for the users' contributions, which is a positive emotion.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet is in response to the Notre Dame Cathedral Fire, which suggests a significant event has occurred.
* The tone of the tweet is positive and appreciative towards the passengers who shared their stories.
* There are no negative or critical words used in the tweet.

Given these points, it's likely that the author intended to convey:

**joy**

The use of "grateful" implies a sense of appreciation and happiness, which aligns with the emotion category of joy.
