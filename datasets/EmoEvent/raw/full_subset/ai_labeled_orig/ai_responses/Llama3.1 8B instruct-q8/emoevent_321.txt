Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author mentions a "devastating" event, which typically connotes a negative emotion.
* However, the author also uses the word "so thankful", which suggests a positive sentiment.

Given these points, it seems that the author is expressing gratitude or relief in response to a tragic event, rather than emotions like anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise. 

**joy**

(Note: While the tweet's tone may seem unusual or even counterintuitive given the context of a devastating fire, the author explicitly states they are "so thankful", which aligns with the emotion category of joy.)

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet mentions a devastating event, which typically evokes a negative emotional response.
* However, the author's tone is not one of outrage or criticism, but rather appreciation and gratitude.
* The use of "#thankful" explicitly indicates a positive emotion.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label for this tweet is:

**joy**

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet mentions a "devastating" event, implying that the fire had a significant negative impact.
* However, the author also uses the phrase "#thankful", which suggests that they are expressing gratitude rather than despair.

Given these considerations, it's clear that the author is expressing an emotion that is opposite of sadness or fear. Since "devastating" typically connotes a negative outcome, it's likely that the author is not feeling angry, disgusted, or fearful. The use of "#thankful" in the context of a devastating event suggests that the author may be experiencing surprise at their own reaction.

However, considering the absurdity and unexpected nature of expressing gratitude for a devastating event, **surprise** seems to be the most fitting emotion label.
