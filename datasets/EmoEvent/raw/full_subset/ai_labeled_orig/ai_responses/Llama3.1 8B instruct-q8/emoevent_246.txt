Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is criticizing a team's (Liverpool) performance.
* The criticism is focused on a specific aspect of their play (touch in the final third).
* The tone appears to be objective and analytical.

Given these points, the emotion conveyed by the author is likely one of disappointment or dissatisfaction with the team's performance, which leans towards **sadness**. However, since sadness encompasses a broad range of negative emotions, it's also possible that the author intended to convey annoyance or frustration, which are more closely related to anger. Considering the context and tone, I would say:

* The closest match for this emotion label is not available in the list, but if we consider 'anger' as a broader category including annoyance and frustration, then: **anger**

* The author is expressing a critical opinion about a team's (Liverpool) performance.
* The criticism is focused on their inability to effectively use possession of the ball.
* The tone is neutral and objective, aiming to provide an analysis rather than express emotion.

The author's criticism implies a level of dissatisfaction or disappointment with Liverpool's performance. While the tone is not overly harsh, it conveys a sense of discontent that can be classified under disgust (or dislike).

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The author is criticizing a team's (Liverpool) performance.
* The criticism is focused on a specific aspect of their game (touch in the final third).
* The tone appears to be objective and analytical, rather than emotional or personal.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is: **disgust** (as it includes disinterest and dislike).

Note that the author's intention may not necessarily be "disgust" in the classical sense, but rather a critical and somewhat dismissive tone. However, among the provided options, disgust seems to be the closest match.
