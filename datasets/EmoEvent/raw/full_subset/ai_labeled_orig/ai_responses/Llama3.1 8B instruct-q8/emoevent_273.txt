Response 1:
Important points to consider:
- The text describes a hypothetical scenario where someone's devotion is described as "absolute divine", implying a sense of wonder and awe.
- The phrase "Who is absolute divine? What is her name?" suggests curiosity rather than criticism or disdain.
- There are no explicit indicators of negative emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise.

**joy**
The tone of the tweet appears to be celebratory and enthusiastic, suggesting that the author intends to convey a sense of joy.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The text appears to be a cryptic message with no clear connection to reading, publishing, or copyright.
* It mentions "#WorldBookDay" but does not convey any enthusiasm or positivity towards the event.
* The language used is vague and mysterious, with words like "absolute divine", "devotion", and phrases that seem out of context for a book-related celebration.

Given these points, it's unlikely that the author intended to convey a positive or celebratory tone. 

**sadness** seems to be an unlikely fit as well, since there is no clear indication of loss or melancholy in the text.

The mention of "User User" and the link may indicate that the tweet is not about World Book Day at all, but rather about something else entirely.

After considering these factors, **surprise** seems to be a plausible emotion, as the author's tone appears to be enigmatic and attention-grabbing, with an air of mystery surrounding the content.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet appears to be a quote from a poem or a song, rather than an original statement by the author.
* The language used is somewhat cryptic and enigmatic, with phrases such as "absolute divine" and "her devotion".
* There is no apparent criticism or negativity expressed in the text.

Given these considerations, I would classify the emotion of the author as **joy**. The tone of the quote seems to be lyrical and celebratory, suggesting a sense of wonder and delight.
