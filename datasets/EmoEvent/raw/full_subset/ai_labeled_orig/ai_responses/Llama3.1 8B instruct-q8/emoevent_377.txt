Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet mentions the Notre Dame Cathedral Fire, which is a somber and serious event.
* However, the tone of the tweet seems critical and questioning rather than mournful or shocked.
* The phrase "Amazing there are homeless all over the world" suggests that the author is highlighting an injustice rather than expressing admiration or awe.
* The hashtag #povity implies a sense of irony and criticism.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**. The tweet conveys a sense of outrage and frustration at the contrast between the large amount of money raised for the cathedral's restoration and the lack of support for homeless people worldwide.

**anger**
The author's tone is critical and judgmental, implying a sense of outrage or indignation at the perceived disparity between how society responds to disasters like the Notre Dame fire versus the struggles faced by homeless people.
