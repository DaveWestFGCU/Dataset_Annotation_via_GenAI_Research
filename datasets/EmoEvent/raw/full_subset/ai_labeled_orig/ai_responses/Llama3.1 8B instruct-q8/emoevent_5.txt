Important points to consider:

* Despite this, they express feeling "really uneasy" about the fire, indicating a negative emotional response.
* They question why the fire occurred now, implying concern or unease about the timing and significance of the event.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

* The author explicitly states that they "don't like it!", indicating a negative emotional response.
