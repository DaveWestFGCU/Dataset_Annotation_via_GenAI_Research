Response 1:
Here are some important points to consider when classifying the tweet:

* The author mentions wanting to visit a place they mistakenly refer to as a "museum" (when in fact, it is a cathedral).
* The author expresses emotional attachment or affection towards Notre-Dame Cathedral ("beautiful").
* The context of the conversation appears to be about the recent fire at Notre-Dame Cathedral.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label for this tweet is:

**sadness**

This classification makes sense because the author seems to be expressing regret and disappointment that their opportunity to visit Notre-Dame Cathedral was compromised due to a tragic event (the fire).

* The use of the ðŸ˜¢ emoji, a crying face, further indicates that the author is experiencing sadness.

**sadness**

Note: The mention of it being "not just another church" may also imply a sense of significance or importance to the author, but overall, the tone and language used convey a sense of loss and sorrow.
