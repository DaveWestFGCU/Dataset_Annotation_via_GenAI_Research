Response 1:
Here are some important points to consider:

* The tweet seems to be unrelated to the Notre Dame Cathedral fire, as it mentions "loved your story on construction guys" which is a completely different topic.
* The tone appears to be lighthearted and casual, mentioning that the best day for construction workers is when they complete a job without injuries.
* There is no mention of emotion related to the fire itself.

Given these points, I would classify the tweet as:

**joy**

The author seems to be expressing a positive sentiment, using phrases like "loved your story" and "the best day", which suggest happiness and appreciation. The tone is lighthearted and casual, without any mention of the fire or its aftermath.
