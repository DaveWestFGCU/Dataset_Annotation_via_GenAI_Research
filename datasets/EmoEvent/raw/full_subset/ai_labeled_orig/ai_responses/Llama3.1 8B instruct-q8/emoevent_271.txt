Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The author is expressing skepticism about the age of a relic (the Crown of Thorns) in relation to the Notre Dame Cathedral fire.
* The tone seems to be questioning and inquiring, rather than expressing strong emotions.
* The use of phrases such as "Are you kidding me?" is rhetorical, indicating the author is seeking an answer or expression of surprise, rather than genuinely being angry.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**surprise**
