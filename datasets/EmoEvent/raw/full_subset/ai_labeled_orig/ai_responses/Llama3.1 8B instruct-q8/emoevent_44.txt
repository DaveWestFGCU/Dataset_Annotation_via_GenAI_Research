Important points to consider:

* The author mentions "bereavement" and "Cancer", which suggest a personal experience of loss or hardship.
* Despite the serious tone, the author ends with "#Happy #WorldBookDay!", indicating a sense of appreciation or joy.
* However, the context of bereavement and cancer suggests that the author's initial tone is more somber than joyful.

Considering these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**sadness**

Note: The use of "bereavement" and "Cancer" suggests a somber tone, but the inclusion of "#Happy #WorldBookDay!" at the end softens this to a more nuanced sadness rather than an outright expression of grief.
