The most relevant emotion label is: **surprise**

Response 2:
Here are the important points to consider given the text:

* The tweet is a notification about an "important message" from a student representative, suggesting that it may be related to a pressing issue.
* The hashtags #Fridaysforfuture and #ClimateStrike indicate that the topic is climate change and activism.
* The fact that the tweet mentions Greta Thunberg, a prominent environmental activist, further suggests that the content will be related to climate action.

Given these points, it's likely that the author intended to convey **joy**, as the tone of the tweet appears to be positive and informative, suggesting excitement or enthusiasm about sharing an important message.

Response 3:
To classify the tweet's emotion, let's consider the following points:

* The message is labeled as "important", which suggests that it may convey a sense of urgency or seriousness.
* It mentions #Fridaysforfuture and #ClimateStrike, indicating that it is related to the climate change movement, which often involves protests and activism.
* The tweet includes a link, but there's no mention of what it leads to, making it difficult to infer the tone from this aspect alone.

Given these points, I would classify the emotion as **surprise**. This is because the tweet appears to be an announcement or notification about something important, which may prompt surprise in the reader (e.g., "Oh, there's a new update from Fridays for Future"). The seriousness and importance of the topic also align with surprise rather than other emotions like joy, sadness, or disgust, which might imply a more personal connection or strong emotional reaction.
