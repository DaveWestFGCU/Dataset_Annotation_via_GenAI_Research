**surprise**

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet is short and informal, suggesting a casual tone.
* The author asks a question, indicating uncertainty or curiosity.
* The use of double exclamation marks at the end implies excitement or eagerness.

Given these points, I would classify the emotion as **surprise**. The author seems excited and curious about the faceless man, which suggests they are surprised or intrigued by this element in Game of Thrones.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the tweet appears casual and playful.
* The author is asking a question, indicating curiosity rather than expressing an emotion directly.
* The mention of a character from Game of Thrones suggests that the author is enthusiastic about the show.

Given these points, I would classify the tweet as:

**surprise**
The author's use of "!!" at the end of the sentence and the phrase "Anyone noticed" suggest that they are expressing surprise or amazement that no one has commented on a particular aspect of Game of Thrones.
