Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The text mentions a Sunday election, which may have been the source of confusion in the original statement.
* The correct date for the 2019 Spanish general election is April 28, not April 2018. However, this information is not relevant to classifying the emotion intended by the author.
* The phrase "kick fascism butts" implies a strong negative sentiment towards a particular ideology or system.
* The use of an affection symbol (ðŸ’œ) and positive phrases ("Another beautiful Sunday evening", "Feliz Domingo") suggests a celebratory tone.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**joy**

The author appears to be expressing enthusiasm and positivity about the upcoming election and the opportunity to challenge fascism.

Response 3:
Here are the important points to consider:

* The tweet mentions a positive aspect ("beautiful Sunday evening") and a negative one ("kick fascism butts"), which might suggest a mix of emotions.
* The phrase "kick fascism butts" is strong language that could indicate a sense of urgency or defiance.
* The use of ðŸ’œ, a heart symbol often associated with love and affection, might soften the tone of the message.

Given these points, I would classify the emotion as **joy**. The overall tone of the tweet seems to be celebratory and encouraging, with a focus on kicking out fascism rather than expressing anger or fear. The use of positive language and emojis reinforces this interpretation.
