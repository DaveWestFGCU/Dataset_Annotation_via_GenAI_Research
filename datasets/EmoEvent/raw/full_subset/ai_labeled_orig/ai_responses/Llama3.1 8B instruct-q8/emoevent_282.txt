Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The tweet is referencing a situation involving Venezuela.
* The author is suggesting a double standard by comparing a hypothetical reaction in a white-majority country to the current situation in Venezuela.
* The tone of the tweet appears to be rhetorical, implying that the author believes there would indeed be international outrage if the situation were reversed.

Based on these points, it seems that the author intended to convey **anger**, as they are expressing frustration and indignation at what they perceive as a double standard.

Important points to consider:

* The tweet references a hypothetical scenario where a similar incident occurs in a different context (a "white majority country").
* The author implies that there would be significant outrage if this incident had occurred in such a country.
* The tone of the tweet seems to suggest a sense of incredulity and frustration.

Based on these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**anger**

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The author is drawing a comparison between two scenarios: one involving Venezuela and another hypothetical scenario where the driver was white in a white majority country.
* The author uses rhetorical questions, which suggests a tone of shock or incredulity.
* The hashtag #Venezuela and the link suggest that the tweet is related to an event or incident in Venezuela.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**surprise**

The author's use of rhetorical questions and the phrase "Wow" suggests a tone of astonishment or shock at the perceived disparity in how the situation would be treated if it were happening in a different context.
