Important points to consider:

* The author is referring to a TV show they seem to enjoy.
* They use the phrase "No comment" which implies that they're being sarcastic or ironic about not commenting, but then proceed to express their enthusiasm.
* The language used ("Just fucking amazing") suggests strong positive emotions.

Given these points, I would classify the tweet as:

**joy**

The author's tone is overwhelmingly enthusiastic and excited about the show, indicating a strong positive emotional response.
