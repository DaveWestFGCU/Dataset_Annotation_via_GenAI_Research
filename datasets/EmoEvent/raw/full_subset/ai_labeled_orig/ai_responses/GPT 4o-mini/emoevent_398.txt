Response 1:
Important points to consider:
- The tweet references a specific event (Liverpool winning the league) and contrasts it with how others remember it (or do not remember it).
- The use of "Anyone remember" implies a sense of nostalgia or reflection on past events.
- The inclusion of "Nope" suggests a dismissive attitude towards the past achievement.
- Hashtags indicate a connection to football and possibly a rivalry between clubs (Liverpool vs. Manchester United).
- The tone seems to carry a mix of playfulness and sarcasm.

Given these points, the writer may be expressing frustration or amusement related to the memory of the event, leaning towards a negative sentiment towards how it is remembered by others, possibly due to rivalry. 

Thus, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**.
