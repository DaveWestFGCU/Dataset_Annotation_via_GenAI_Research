Important points to consider from the tweet:

1. The author expresses affection and admiration toward George Takei by stating "I love you" and "YOU ROCK."
2. The use of "Keep telling it like it is!" suggests a sense of appreciation for Takei's honesty and advocacy, which elicits a positive sentiment.
3. The hashtags, particularly #NotreDameCathedralFire, along with the political context involving Trump, may indicate a connection to a moment of societal loss or a strong opinion on political issues.

Considering these points, the overall sentiment leans towards a positive and supportive emotion related to admiration or love for an individual's stance, but in the context of the tragedy implied by the Notre Dame fire, there is also an undertone of sadness or concern.
