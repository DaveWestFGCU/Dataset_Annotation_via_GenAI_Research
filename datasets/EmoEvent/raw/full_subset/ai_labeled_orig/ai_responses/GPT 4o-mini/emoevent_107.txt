Response 1:
To classify the emotion intended by the author in the tweet, consider the following points:

1. The phrase "lost many beloved characters" suggests a sense of loss, which often conveys sadness, especially in the context of a narrative where viewers develop attachment to characters.
2. The use of "beloved characters" further emphasizes that the loss is significant and impactful to the audience.
3. The continuation of the tweet with "but one stood out from the rest" might imply some interest or positive focus on the remaining character, but it does not negate the overall sentiment of loss.
4. There is no indication of anger, disgust, fear, joy, or surprise; the primary emotional weight lies in the sense of loss and disappointment from the departure of favored characters.

Considering these points, the most relevant emotion label is **sadness**.
