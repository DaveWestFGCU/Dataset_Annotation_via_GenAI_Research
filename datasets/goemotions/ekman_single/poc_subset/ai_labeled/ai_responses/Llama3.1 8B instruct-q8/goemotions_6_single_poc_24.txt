Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses a phrase "Sorry but" which may indicate they are not truly sorry, but rather a polite expression.
* The tone of the comment appears to be questioning or skeptical.
* The speaker is responding to someone's mention of their affiliation with another Reddit community (/r/All).
* There is no apparent criticism, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise in the statement.

Based on these points, the most relevant emotion label is **neutral**.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the sentence is questioning and somewhat defensive.
* The speaker is responding to an earlier statement or claim made by someone else, implying a potential conflict or disagreement.
* The language used is straightforward and to-the-point, without any embellishments or emotional appeals.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is **neutral**. The speaker's tone is not overtly angry, fearful, disgusted, joyful, or surprised; rather, it seems to be simply expressing a question or skepticism about why someone's affiliation with another subreddit should matter.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker sounds defensive, using "Sorry" which can be an apologetic tone, but also a way to preemptively diffuse tension.
* The phrase "why does it matter" implies a sense of puzzlement or frustration that the other person is making a point of their origin.
* The use of quotation marks around "/r/All" suggests that the speaker thinks this distinction is somehow arbitrary or unnecessary.

Given these points, the emotion most people will feel the speaker may be feeling is:

**anger**

The speaker's tone comes across as slightly irritated and defensive, which is characteristic of anger. They're not using aggressive language, but their use of "Sorry" and the quotation marks around "/r/All" suggest that they're feeling a bit frustrated or annoyed with the other person's point.
