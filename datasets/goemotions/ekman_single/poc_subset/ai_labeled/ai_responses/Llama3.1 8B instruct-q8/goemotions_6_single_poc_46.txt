Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses the phrase "went down the toilet", which is an idiomatic expression for something declining or failing.
* However, they immediately follow this with "but that then actually make a comeback", implying that there may be hope or potential for recovery.

Response 4:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses the phrase "went down the toilet", which can imply a negative or disappointing outcome.
* However, they immediately follow this with a question about whether such franchises have made a comeback, which suggests some level of curiosity and interest.
* The tone is somewhat philosophical and reflective, rather than emotional or confrontational.

Given these points, the speaker's comment appears to be more neutral in its emotional tone. While there may be an underlying sense of sadness or disappointment that the franchise did not succeed, this emotion is not explicitly expressed and is overshadowed by the speaker's curiosity about potential comebacks. 

**neutral**
