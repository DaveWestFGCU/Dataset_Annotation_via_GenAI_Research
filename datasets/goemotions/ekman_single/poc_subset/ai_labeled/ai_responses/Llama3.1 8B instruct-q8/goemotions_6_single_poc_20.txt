Response 1:
Here are some important points to consider given the text:

* The speaker responds with a phrase that could be interpreted as sarcastic or ironic.
* The phrase is short and lacks any emotional language typically associated with strong emotions (e.g., no profanity, no extreme adjectives).
* The response does not express empathy, agreement, or disagreement.

Based on these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**surprise**
 
The speaker's use of a seemingly out-of-place phrase ("the true third gender") could be interpreted as an attempt to surprise or provoke another commenter, rather than expressing any strong emotions like anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or neutrality.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the statement appears to be matter-of-fact and non-judgmental.
* There is no apparent emotion-laden language or punctuation (e.g., exclamation marks, sarcasm).
* The phrase "the true third gender" seems to be a neutral observation rather than an emotional reaction.

Given these points, the speaker's statement appears to convey a sense of **neutral**.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker responds with a brief phrase that acknowledges and agrees with the idea of a "third gender".
* There is no apparent criticism, negativity, or emotional distress in the response.
* The tone appears to be matter-of-fact and non-confrontational.

Given these considerations, I would categorize the emotion as:

**surprise**
 
The speaker's brief response seems to express agreement with an unexpected idea, which could imply surprise or astonishment at the concept of a "third gender". However, without more context, it is also possible that the speaker was simply agreeing with the original post or another commenter.
