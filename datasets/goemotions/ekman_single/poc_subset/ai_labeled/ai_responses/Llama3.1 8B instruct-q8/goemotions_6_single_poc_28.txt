Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions that someone attempted to use a manipulative tactic, implying they were trying to gain an advantage.
* The speaker implies that this tactic backfired and had negative consequences for the person who used it.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is: **anger**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions that someone played a manipulative game ("the 'I know a secret' game") during a serious setting (a hearing).
* The speaker notes that this tactic "blew up" in the person's face, implying a negative outcome.

Given these points, it is likely that the speaker is expressing a sense of satisfaction or approval at the fact that the manipulative tactic failed. However, there is no explicit emotion of joy or amusement, and instead, the tone seems to be more subdued.

**anger**

This response may seem counterintuitive given that anger typically involves a strong emotional response, but in this case, the speaker's comment suggests a sense of approval at the person's failure, rather than outright anger. The correct answer is actually **neutral**, as there is no clear indication of any strong emotion other than a matter-of-fact statement about the event.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker seems to be describing a situation where someone attempted to use manipulative tactics ("playing the 'I know a secret' game") during a public hearing.
* However, these tactics ultimately backfired, as they "blew up" or failed.

Given this context, here are some possible interpretations of the speaker's emotion:

* The tone is somewhat sarcastic and triumphant, suggesting that the speaker is pleased with the outcome. This implies that the speaker may be experiencing joy.
* However, there is also a hint of mocking tone towards the person who tried to use manipulative tactics, which might suggest anger or disgust.

After careful consideration, I would say that the most relevant emotion label is:

**joy**

The speaker's tone seems to be more celebratory and approving (implying joy) rather than angry or disgusted. The phrase "it blew up in her" has a somewhat triumphant and sarcastic tone, which fits with the definition of joy.
