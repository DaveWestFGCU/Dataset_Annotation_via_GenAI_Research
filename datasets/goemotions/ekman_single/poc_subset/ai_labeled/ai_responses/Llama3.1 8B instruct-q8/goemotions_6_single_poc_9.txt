Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is responding to someone else's comment about making themselves undesirable for dating.
* The speaker claims to have had the opposite experience, trying to make themselves more attractive but still being unsuccessful in finding a partner.

Given these points, it appears that the speaker is likely experiencing **sadness**. The tone of the response suggests a sense of disappointment and frustration with their own failed attempts at dating, which aligns with the emotion category definitions for sadness.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is responding to someone who has claimed to be making themselves undateable.
* The speaker's response implies a sense of irony or mockery, as they are essentially saying that they are trying to do the opposite but failing anyway.

Given these points, it seems likely that the speaker's tone is lighthearted and humorous. They may be poking fun at their own dating life and implying that they are somehow still unsuccessful despite trying to make themselves more attractive.

**joy**

The speaker's response has a playful and tongue-in-cheek quality to it, which is characteristic of joy or amusement. The use of the phrase "raise you" also implies a sense of friendly competition or banter, which further suggests that the speaker is feeling joyful or enthusiastic about their response.
