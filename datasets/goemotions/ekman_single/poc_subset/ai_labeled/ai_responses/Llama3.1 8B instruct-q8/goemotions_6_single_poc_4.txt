* The speaker mentions that someone found something humorous ("hilarious").
* The word "aghast" implies shock or astonishment, but in this context, it seems to be used in a more ironic or playful way.

Based on these points, I would infer that the speaker is finding humor in the situation and is not expressing any negative emotions. Therefore, the most relevant emotion label is:
