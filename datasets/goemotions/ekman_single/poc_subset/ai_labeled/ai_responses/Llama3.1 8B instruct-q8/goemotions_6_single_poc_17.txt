Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker seems to be disagreeing with someone else's opinion, indicating a potential emotional response.
* The phrase "way over the top" suggests an exaggeration or hyperbole, which may indicate a negative emotion.
* The use of "not anywhere near that bad" implies a corrective or mitigating tone.

Most relevant emotion label: **surprise** 
The speaker appears to be surprised by someone else's extreme opinion and is disagreeing with it. This surprise is likely driving their response rather than anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or neutrality.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is responding to someone else's statement about someone being "way over the top" and "not anywhere near that bad", implying a correction or disagreement.
* The tone of the comment seems to be calm and matter-of-fact, rather than emotional or confrontational.

Given these considerations, I would categorize the emotion as:

**neutral**
The speaker appears to be providing a straightforward assessment or correction without expressing any strong emotions. There is no indication of anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise in their response.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses the phrase "way over the top", which implies an excessive or unreasonable criticism.
* The word "bad" is used in a comparative sense, suggesting that the speaker thinks the person being criticized is not as bad as others may have made them out to be.
* The tone of the response seems to be defensive and corrective.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**joy**

The speaker's comment has a positive and uplifting tone, which suggests they are happy to see someone being defended or corrected. They seem to take pleasure in pointing out that the criticism was excessive, which implies a sense of satisfaction or joy in seeing justice being served.

Response 4:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses the phrase "way over the top," which implies an opinion that something is excessive or unreasonable.
* They then state their disagreement with the previous statement by saying "He's not anywhere near that bad," suggesting a contrast between the original assessment and their own more positive evaluation.

Given these points, it appears the speaker is disagreeing with another commenter and offering a corrective assessment. This type of response typically suggests a neutral or slightly positive tone, as they are attempting to provide an alternative perspective without expressing strong emotions like anger or disgust.

However, since there isn't enough information to confirm complete neutrality (the speaker could still be upset despite their measured language), and the tone is not overly negative, I would lean towards:

**neutral**

This choice acknowledges that the speaker is offering a counterpoint, but in a relatively calm and objective manner.
