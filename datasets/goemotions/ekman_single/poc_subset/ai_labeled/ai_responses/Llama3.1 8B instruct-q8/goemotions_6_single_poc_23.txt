Response 1:
Here are some important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions solo climbing to Master level, which suggests a significant achievement.
* They specify that they did it as the main DPS (damage per second), implying a focus on their own performance rather than teamwork.
* However, they downplay the accomplishment with "it really doesn't matter."
* This phrase has a dismissive tone, but it's unclear whether the speaker is being humble or sarcastic.

Given these points, I would say that the speaker is likely feeling **surprise**. The reason is that their achievement (solo climbing to Master level as main DPS with 60hz) seems significant and impressive, yet they respond with a dismissive phrase that implies it's not a big deal. This contrast between the effort and their understatement suggests surprise or astonishment at their own accomplishment.

However, another possible interpretation is that the speaker is feeling **neutral**. Their response could be seen as a matter-of-fact statement rather than an emotional one. They're simply stating that it doesn't matter, which might indicate a lack of strong emotion.

That being said, I think surprise is a more likely interpretation because their achievement seems notable and they respond with a phrase that downplays its significance.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the sentence seems dismissive and unimpressed.
* The speaker emphasizes their personal achievement (solo climbing to Master as main DPS).
* The phrase "It really doesn't matter" suggests that the speaker is downplaying or devaluing the significance of their accomplishment.

Given these considerations, the emotion most people will feel the speaker may be feeling is:

**surprise**
 
Reasoning: Although the tone appears dismissive and unimpressed, it's also somewhat unexpected. Typically, someone who has achieved a difficult task like solo climbing to Master as main DPS would express more enthusiasm or pride. The speaker's apparent lack of excitement and dismissal of their own accomplishment seems surprising, which is why I've labeled this emotion **surprise**.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions solo climbing to Master rank, which suggests they achieved something difficult.
* They mention playing the game at 60hz, which implies a high level of technical proficiency or dedication.
* However, their tone is dismissive and somewhat sarcastic when they say "It really doesn't matter."
* This phrase could imply that the speaker feels their achievement isn't being acknowledged or appreciated by others.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**anger**
 
This is because the speaker's tone comes across as slightly irritated or annoyed that their achievement isn't being recognized. They're expressing a sense of displeasure and disapproval at the lack of acknowledgment, which aligns with the definition of anger.
