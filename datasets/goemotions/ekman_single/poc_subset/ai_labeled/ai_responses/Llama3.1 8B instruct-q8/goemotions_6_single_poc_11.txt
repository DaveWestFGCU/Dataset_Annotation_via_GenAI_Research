Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is presenting a new word they've learned.
* The definition of the word emphasizes negative emotions, specifically being bad-tempered and irritable.
* The speaker provides an example sentence that illustrates how the person in the sentence is perceived as tetchy.

Given these points, the emotion most likely felt by the speaker appears to be:

**sadness**

The reason for this choice is that the speaker's presentation of the word "tetchy" and its definition comes with a connotation of sadness or disappointment. The example sentence implies that the person being described as tetchy has some negative qualities, which might evoke feelings of sadness in the speaker if they have a personal connection to the individual or are sympathizing with them.
