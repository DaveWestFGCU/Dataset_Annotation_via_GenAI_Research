Alright, I need to figure out the emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. Let's look at the sentence: "The internationalist EU. The [NAME], [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] are just brimming with all that international SOLIDARITY ❤️."

First, I notice the word "SOLIDARITY" which has a positive connotation. Solidarity usually refers to unity or support among people, so that's a good indicator of a positive emotion.

The speaker is talking about the EU and mentions names presumably of countries or groups within the EU. Using words like "brimming with" suggests abundance, which is positive. The use of a heart emoji ❤️ further reinforces a positive feeling, likely joy.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral. Joy fits here because it's about happiness and approval. They're expressing approval and positive feelings towards the solidarity within the EU.

I don't see any signs of anger or disgust in the words used; there's no negative language. Fear isn't indicated either. Surprise would require something unexpected, but this seems more celebratory. Neutral is out because there's clear emotion expressed.

So, putting it all together, the emotion here is joy.

Alright, let me try to figure out the emotion behind this comment. So the speaker is talking about the EU and some names mentioned, saying they're "brimming with all that international SOLIDARITY ❤️." The emojis are pretty telling here—especially the heart eyes. That usually indicates affection or positive feelings.

Looking at the words used: "internationalist EU" suggests support for unity or cooperation, which is a positive stance. Words like "solidarity" and the inclusion of hearts both point towards joy or happiness. There's no negative language; instead, it's all praise and warmth.

I should consider each emotion category. Anger? Doesn't seem so—no harsh words or criticism. Disgust? No signs of revulsion here. Fear? The tone is positive, not worried. Sadness? Unlikely, as the message is uplifting. Surprise? Not really, unless something unexpected was mentioned, but it's a supportive statement.

So the emotion that fits best is joy because of the positive sentiment and the use of emojis indicating happiness.

Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. Let's look at the sentence they used: "The internationalist EU. The [NAME], [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] are just brimming with all that international SOLIDARITY ❤️"

First, breaking down the words. They mention "international solidarity," which sounds positive. Solidarity usually means unity or togetherness, so that's a good sign. They also use a heart emoji, which is commonly associated with love or affection.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral. The comment doesn't show any signs of negative emotions like anger or disgust. There's no indication of fear or sadness either. It's not really neutral because they're expressing something.

The heart emoji and the words "brimming with solidarity" suggest a positive emotion. Joy includes feelings like happiness, approval, and love. Since they're showing affection towards the internationalism and solidarity, joy fits here. The exclamation mark and heart symbolize excitement or approval, which are part of joy.

So, putting it all together, the speaker is expressing joy through their comment.
