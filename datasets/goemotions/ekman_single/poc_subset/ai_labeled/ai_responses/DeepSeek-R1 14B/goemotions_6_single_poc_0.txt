Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is, "I love it. Probably my favorite game mode right now. Especially when playing with a buddy." Let me break this down step by step.

First, I look at the words used. They start with "I love it," which immediately suggests a positive emotion. "Love" is a strong indicator of joy or happiness. Then they mention it's their "favorite game mode right now," which again emphasizes enjoyment and preference, aligning with joy.

The next part is about playing with a buddy. This adds a social aspect to their enjoyment. Enjoying something with a friend usually enhances positive feelings, so this reinforces the idea of joy rather than any other emotion.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, sadness, surprise are all negative or neutral, but the speaker's words are clearly positive. Neutral is just lacking emotion, which doesn't fit here. So, between the given options, joy seems to be the most fitting emotion.

I don't see any signs of anger or frustration in their tone; instead, it's appreciative and enthusiastic. There's no disgust because they're expressing love for something. Fear isn't present either since there's no indication of worry or anxiety. Sadness is out of the question because they're talking about liking something.

Surprise might be considered if they were reacting to an unexpected event, but here their reaction is more about enjoyment than astonishment. Therefore, joy is the emotion that best captures what the speaker is feeling.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a Reddit comment and wants me to determine the emotion the speaker is feeling from the given options.

First, I'll read the comment: "I love it. Probably my favorite game mode right now. Especially when playing with a buddy." 

The key words here are "love," "favorite," and "especially when playing with a buddy." These terms clearly express positive feelings. The word "love" is strong and directly indicates joy.

Looking at the emotion categories, joy includes feelings like happiness and pleasure. The speaker's use of enthusiastic language suggests they're expressing joy about their favorite game mode, especially when enjoyed socially with a friend.

I'll consider other options to rule them out. There's no sign of anger or disgust in the comment; it's positive. No fear or surprise either. Sadness isn't present since the tone is upbeat. Neutral is also not applicable because emotions are clearly expressed.

So, the emotion that fits best here is joy.
