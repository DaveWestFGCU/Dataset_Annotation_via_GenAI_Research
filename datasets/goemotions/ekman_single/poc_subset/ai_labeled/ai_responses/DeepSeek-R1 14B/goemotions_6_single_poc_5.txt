Alright, let's try to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is: "qt 3.14" made me retreat into my own face, so much second hand cringe."

First, I need to understand what each part of this sentence means. The phrase "retreat into my own face" sounds a bit odd, but I think it's metaphorical. Maybe the speaker is saying they felt awkward or self-conscious because of something that happened.

Then there's "so much second hand cringe." Second-hand cringe refers to feeling embarrassed or uncomfortable because someone else is being awkward or cringeworthy. So putting it together, the speaker probably feels embarrassment because of this situation.

Now, looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral. Embarrassment isn't one of these, but I can map it to the closest category. Let's see:

- Anger is about displeasure or antagonism; not really fitting here.
- Disgust is revulsion towards something unpleasant; maybe if they felt disgusted by someone else's behavior.
- Fear involves being afraid or worried; doesn't seem right.
- Joy is happiness, obviously not this case.
- Sadness is emotional pain; embarrassment can sometimes overlap with sadness but isn't exactly the same.
- Surprise is about astonishment; not quite here either.
- Neutral is no emotion.

Wait, maybe I should consider if it's disgust. Disgust can also include strong disapproval. If someone else did something cringeworthy, perhaps the speaker feels disgusted by their actions. That might make sense because "second hand cringe" could imply that the behavior was not just awkward but maybe socially unacceptable or恶心 (disgusting in Chinese).

Alternatively, it's possible they're feeling surprise if what happened was unexpected. But the emphasis seems to be on the negative emotion resulting from the situation, which is more about disapproval.

So between disgust and neutral. The speaker didn't express any positive emotions. They were clearly affected negatively by "qt 3.14." Therefore, the emotion here is likely disgust because of the strong disapproving feeling towards the cringeworthy behavior.

Alright, let's break down this query step by step. The user wants to identify the emotion someone is feeling based on a short text snippet they spoke. They've provided specific emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and neutral.

Looking at the example given: "qt 3.14" made me retreat into my own face, so much second hand cringe." The phrase "retreat into my own face" is a bit unusual, but it likely means the speaker felt awkward or self-conscious in a social situation. The mention of "second-hand cringe" indicates they're reacting to someone else's embarrassment or discomfort.

Now, considering the emotion definitions: Disgust involves revulsion or strong disapproval. While the statement isn't explicitly about something unpleasant, the feeling of retreating and cringing could stem from finding the situation distasteful or awkward, which aligns with disgust. It's not anger because there's no clear frustration expressed. Fear is more about being afraid, which doesn't quite fit here. Joy, surprise, sadness, and neutral don't seem applicable either.

So, putting it all together, the emotion most relevant here is disgust.

Okay, I need to figure out the emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment: "qt 3.14" made me retreat into my own face, so much second hand cringe."

First, let's break down what they're saying. The phrase "retreat into my own face" might be a metaphor for feeling awkward or embarrassed, maybe even hiding one's face because of discomfort. Then they mention "second-hand cringe," which suggests that whatever happened was so embarrassing that it affected them vicariously.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger is about displeasure, disgust is revulsion, fear is worry, joy is happiness, sadness is sorrow, surprise is astonishment, and neutral is no emotion. 

The speaker isn't expressing anger or joy; there's no indication of strong positive or negative feelings beyond embarrassment. They're not feeling fear or surprise either. Sadness would involve more grief or disappointment, which doesn't fit here.

Disgust could be a possibility because they describe something as cringe-worthy, but in this context, it's more about embarrassment rather than revulsion. However, the emotion definitions include disgust as strong disapproval, so maybe that fits. But wait, the primary feeling expressed is embarrassment, which isn't one of the listed emotions. So I have to pick from the given categories.

Alternatively, "retreat into my own face" might suggest a reaction like feeling awkward or shy, but again, not exactly fitting any emotion except perhaps surprise if it's unexpected. But cringe more relates to embarrassment.

Wait, maybe the correct emotion here is disgust because they are expressing strong disapproval of something being cringeworthy. So "second hand cringe" indicates they're disgusted by the situation.

But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes embarrassment can be part of other emotions. However, based on the definitions provided, disgust includes revulsion or strong disapproval, which fits here when they describe feeling second-hand cringe.

So I think the emotion is disgust.
