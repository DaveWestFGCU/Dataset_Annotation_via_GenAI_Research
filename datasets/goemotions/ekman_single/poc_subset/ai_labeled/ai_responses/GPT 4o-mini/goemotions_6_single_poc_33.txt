Response 2:
In the comment "Just a friend, chill," a few important points to consider are:

1. The phrase "Just a friend" suggests a clarification or defense against an implication or assumption that may have been made by another party.
2. The use of "chill" indicates an urge to calm down or de-escalate the conversation, implying that the speaker perceives some tension or intensity.
3. The overall tone seems casual and somewhat dismissive, potentially reflecting a desire to downplay the situation.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion would be interpreted as one of annoyance or a desire to alleviate tension, which aligns with elements of anger but is not fully intense. However, as the comment does not express strong negative emotion, it leans more towards a neutral reaction.

Therefore, the most relevant emotion label for the speaker is **neutral**.
