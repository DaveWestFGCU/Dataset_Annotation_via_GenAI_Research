In analyzing the speaker's comment "Justified or not he'll probably go before [NAME]," we should consider the following points:

1. The phrase "justified or not" suggests a level of contemplation about the fairness or reasoning behind the situation, indicating a possible moral or ethical dilemma.
2. The use of "he'll probably go" implies a sense of inevitability regarding someone's fate, which can evoke feelings of concern or resignation about the outcome.
3. The context of the comment hints at a situation involving judgment or consequences affecting the mentioned individual, which could lead to feelings of sadness or possibly discontent.
