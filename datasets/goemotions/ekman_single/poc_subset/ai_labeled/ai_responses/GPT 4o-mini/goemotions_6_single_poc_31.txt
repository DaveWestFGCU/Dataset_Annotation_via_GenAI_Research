Response 1:
In this comment, the speaker appears to express a critical tone towards the EU and its representatives, suggesting a sort of mockery or sarcasm concerning their purported international solidarity. The use of "brimming" alongside the heart emoji indicates a contrast where the speaker’s words may not truly reflect admiration but rather a cynical view of the situation, which could evoke feelings of doubt or disappointment regarding the actions of these entities.

Nevertheless, the inclusion of a heart emoji might imply an ironic or playful intent rather than outright anger or disgust. The comment seems to carry a tone that is neither purely negative nor overtly positive but suggests a skepticism about the situation, leaning more towards a neutral stance with a hint of sarcasm.

Overall, considering the tone and the context of the comment, the most relevant emotion label is **neutral**.
