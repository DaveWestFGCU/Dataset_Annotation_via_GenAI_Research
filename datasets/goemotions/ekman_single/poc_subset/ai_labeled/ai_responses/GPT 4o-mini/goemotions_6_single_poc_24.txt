Response 1:
In this comment, the speaker is questioning the significance of someone's affiliation with a particular subreddit. The tone suggests a dismissive or challenging stance towards the other person's claim. The use of "Sorry but why does it matter" indicates a level of annoyance or confusion about the relevance of the statement made by the other person.

Key points to consider:
1. The speaker appears to be questioning the importance or relevance of the other user's statement, which implies a lack of respect for it.
2. The use of "sorry" can indicate a surface politeness that contrasts with the underlying skepticism.
3. This challenge to another's statement shows a sense of displeasure or frustration.

Given these observations, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**.

Response 2:
In the speaker's comment, there is a hint of skepticism or dismissal regarding the value of the other person's affiliation to a subreddit.

There is a lack of positive or neutral sentiment and instead, a tone that suggests irritation or questioning of priority.

Thus, the most relevant emotion label for this text is **anger**.

Response 3:
To analyze the speaker's comment, we need to consider the tone and implications of the phrase. 

1. The speaker begins with an apology ("Sorry but"), which may indicate an attempt to soften their response, suggesting they are not outright angry or hostile. However, the use of "but" typically introduces a contrasting statement.
 
2. The question "why does it matter that you're 'from /r/All'?" implies skepticism or disbelief about the significance of the previous commenterâ€™s claim. This can hint at annoyance as they question the relevance of that information.

3. The overall phrasing suggests a lack of understanding about the importance of the other person's statement or claim, which could lead to feelings of frustration or disdain.

Given these points, combined with the skeptical questioning of the relevance of the comment made by the other user, the emotion most likely felt by the speaker is one of annoyance or disapproval.

Thus, the most relevant emotion label for this comment is **anger**.
