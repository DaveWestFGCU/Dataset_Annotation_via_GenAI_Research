Response 1:
In the given comment, the speaker expresses a sense of achievement in reaching a high skill level (Master rank) while highlighting that they did it under certain limitations (using 60hz). The concluding phrase "It really doesn't matter" suggests a dismissive attitude towards either the importance of the achievement or potentially to the discussion itself. This could imply a sense of pride in their accomplishment but also a level of nonchalance or indifference about it.

- The mention of "solo climbed to Master" indicates a personal achievement and could be tied to feelings of pride or happiness.
- The phrase "It really doesn't matter" might suggest a sense of dismissal, indicating that the speaker feels the achievement is not as significant as others may perceive it.

Overall, the tone seems to reflect a blend of pride in their skill, paired with a degree of nonchalance about the relevance of their accomplishment to others. 

Considering these points, the most fitting emotion label for this comment is **neutral**, as the speaker seems to express confidence but without strong emotional investment in the outcome or its importance.

In the speaker's comment, "I solo climbed to Master as main DPS with 60hz. It really doesnt matter," there are a few points to consider:

1. **Achievement**: The speaker reflects on their accomplishment of reaching a high rank (Master) in a game, which typically suggests a level of skill and dedication.
