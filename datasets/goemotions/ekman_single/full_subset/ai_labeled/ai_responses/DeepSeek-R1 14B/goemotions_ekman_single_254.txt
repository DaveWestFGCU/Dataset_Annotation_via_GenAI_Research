Alright, so I need to figure out what emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is: "I should have at your list that I only hope he gets elected!" 

First, let me break this down. The speaker is talking about having someone on a list and expressing a desire for that person's election. The phrase "only hope" suggests they are wishing or hoping for something positive to happenâ€”specifically, the election of a particular individual.

Looking at the emotion categories provided: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral. I need to choose the most relevant one. 

Joy is defined as feelings of pleasure and happiness, including admiration, approval, desire, etc. The speaker's use of "hope" indicates a positive wish, which aligns with joy.

Other emotions don't seem to fit here. There's no sign of anger or annoyance, so it's not anger. Disgust would involve revulsion, which isn't present. Fear involves being afraid or worried, but the comment is about hoping for something positive, not fearing anything. Sadness relates to emotional pain, which doesn't apply here. Surprise is about astonishment, and while the statement expresses a desire, it's more of a hope than a surprise. Neutral would imply no emotion, but the speaker clearly has an expressed feeling.

So, considering all this, the emotion that best fits the comment is joy because they're expressing a positive wish or hope.

Alright, so I need to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is: "I should have at your list that I only hope he gets elected!" 

First, let me break down what this sentence means. It seems like the speaker is expressing a desire for someone (referred to as "he") to be elected. The phrase "only hope" indicates that they are wishing or hoping for this outcome.

Looking at the emotion categories provided, I need to match this sentiment to one of anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or neutral.

Joy is associated with feelings like pleasure, happiness, excitement, etc. If someone hopes for a positive outcome, especially if it's something they value or are happy about, that would fall under joy. The speaker here seems optimistic about the election outcome, which aligns with joy.

Other emotions don't fit as well. There's no indication of anger or annoyance, so anger is out. Disgust usually involves disapproval or revulsion, which isn't present here. Fear would involve worry or anxiety, but the speaker expresses hope, not fear. Sadness isn't applicable because they're expressing a positive wish. Surprise implies something unexpected, but this statement is straightforward. Neutral doesn't capture the hopeful tone.

So, considering all this, the emotion that best fits is joy.

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is: "I should have at your list that I only hope he gets elected!" 

First, let me break down the sentence. It seems like the speaker is saying they added someone ("he") to a list with the specific desire for him to get elected. The key part here is the use of "hope" and "only." 

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral.

The word "hope" suggests a positive feeling. When someone hopes for something, it's often tied to joy or happiness. In this case, they're hoping that he gets elected, which sounds like a desire for success or good outcomes. 

I don't see any negative emotions here. There's no indication of anger (like frustration), disgust, fear (worry), sadness, surprise, or neutral. The comment is straightforward and expresses a positive wish.

So the emotion most likely being felt here is joy.

The speaker expresses a desire for success, which aligns with joy.
