Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is "Yeah I know u irl you look like ur 36." Let me break this down.

First, looking at the sentence structure and words used. They're addressing someone directly with "u" which is casual but not necessarily emotional. The part "you look like ur 36" seems straightforward. At first glance, it doesn't immediately indicate a strong emotion.

Now, considering the options: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or neutral. Let's go through each.

Anger usually involves frustration or hostility. There's no indication of that here; the comment is more about observation than criticism.

Disgust would involve finding something unpleasant. The statement doesn't express dislike or revulsion, so I don't think it's disgust.

Fear is about being afraid or worried. There's nothing in the comment suggesting fear.

Joy implies happiness or pleasure. This comment isn't particularly positive or exhilarating.

Sadness involves sorrow or disappointment. Again, no negative emotions are expressed here.

Surprise means astonishment or unexpected feelings. The statement seems more like a neutral observation rather than something surprising.

Neutral is when there's no clear emotion expressed. Here, the speaker is making an observation about someone's appearance without any emotional language. It doesn't show happiness, anger, etc., just a fact.

I think the key here is that the comment is factual and not expressing any strong emotion. The speaker is pointing out how the person looks but isn't showing any of the other emotions listed. So, it makes sense to categorize this as neutral.

Alright, let me try to figure this out. The user has provided a query where they need to identify an emotion based on a short text snippet. They've given specific categories and definitions, so I need to use those to determine the most appropriate emotion.

The comment in question is: "Yeah I know u irl you look like ur 36." 

First, I'll break down what this sentence might mean. The speaker is addressing someone they probably know in real life (hence "u irl"). They're pointing out that the person looks older than their online appearance, maybe because of a username or profile picture that seems younger.

Now, considering the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral. 

Looking at the comment, it doesn't seem to express any strong positive emotions like joy or love. There's no indication of fear or anxiety. It also doesn't sound like the speaker is angry or disgusted; they're making an observation rather than expressing a negative emotion.

Could it be surprise? Well, surprise usually involves something unexpected. If the person being addressed had a different appearance in real life, maybe that's surprising, but the tone here isn't shocked or astonished. It's more of a straightforward statement.

What about neutral? The comment is factual and lacks any clear emotional expression. The speaker is stating an observation without showing happiness, sadness, or anger. 

So, putting it all together, the emotion seems to be neutral because there's no evident display of any other specific emotion from the given categories.

Alright, let me try to figure out what emotion the speaker might be feeling based on their comment. The comment is: "Yeah I know u irl you look like ur 36." 

First, I need to break down this sentence. The speaker is addressing someone in person ("u irl"), which probably means they're interacting with them face-to-face or at least aware of who the person is in real life. The statement mentions that the person looks like they are 36 years old. Now, depending on the context, this could be a compliment or an insult.

If I were to analyze this without more context, it's a bit tricky because the tone isn't entirely clear. However, looking at the emotion categories provided: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and neutral. The comment doesn't express any overtly positive or negative emotions like joy or anger. It seems more factual or perhaps slightly teasing.

The phrase "you look like ur 36" might be intended as a joke or a playful observation rather than something meant to insult. If it's meant in a joking manner, the emotion could be neutral because it's not expressing strong feelings either way. Alternatively, if there's an underlying tone of surprise or amusement, but without more context, I can't be sure.

Given that, and considering that sometimes comments on appearances can be neutral unless they're clearly positive or negative, I think the most appropriate emotion here is **neutral**.

The speaker's comment "Yeah I know u irl you look like ur 36" doesn't express a clear emotion. It seems factual or possibly playful without strong emotional indicators.

**neutral**
