Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is: "That's the spirit ðŸ¤£ for me it's more about strangers wanting to hug me. But you do you ðŸ˜Ž". 

First, let me break down what they're saying. They start with "That's the spirit", which sounds positive and approving. The reaction emoji ðŸ¤£ is a laughing face, which usually indicates joy or amusement. So that's a good sign pointing towards joy.

Then they say, "for me it's more about strangers wanting to hug me." This part seems like they're expressing their own experience but in a light-hearted way. They might be talking about how others approach them socially, and they don't mind, perhaps even finding it amusing or something that brings a smile.

The next part is "But you do you ðŸ˜Ž". The emoji used here is a confident or cool one. This phrase suggests approval of the other person's choice, which again ties into positive emotions like joy or support.

Looking at all these elements together: positive language, laughing emoji, and an approving statement. There's no indication of any negative emotion like anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise. The tone is light, supportive, and happy.

So considering the emotion categories, joy seems to fit best because of the laughter and positive reinforcement.

Alright, let's break down this Reddit comment to determine the emotion being conveyed. The speaker says, "That's the spirit ðŸ¤£ for me it's more about strangers wanting to hug me. But you do you ðŸ˜Ž". 

First, I notice the use of an emoji ðŸ¤£, which is a laughing out loud emoji. This usually indicates humor or amusement. The phrase "That's the spirit" is often used positively, suggesting agreement or approval in a light-hearted way.

The speaker then goes on to mention their own experience with strangers wanting to hug them. They seem to be sharing a personal anecdote, but it's presented in a way that doesn't show any negative emotionâ€”more like an observation. The tone here is casual and not serious, which adds to the feeling of joy or positivity.

Finally, they end with "But you do you ðŸ˜Ž", which is encouraging and supportive. The ðŸ˜Ž emoji suggests approval and a laid-back attitude. This reinforces that the speaker is in a good mood and approves of the other person's approach.

Putting it all together, the speaker is expressing agreement in a humorous way, sharing an amusing situation, and giving positive encouragement. There are no signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise. Instead, the overall tone is light, happy, and approving, which points towards joy.

Let me break this down. First, they start with "That's the spirit", which sounds positive, maybe even encouraging. They use an emoji that's a loud laughter (ðŸ˜‚), so that suggests they're amused or finding something funny.

Then they mention, "for me it's more about strangers wanting to hug me." This part seems light-hearted and possibly humorous because being hugged by strangers might be an unusual or funny situation. They're not expressing any negative emotion here; instead, it's more of a playful observation.

Finally, they say, "But you do you ðŸ˜Ž". The emoji used is a shrug with a smirk, which often indicates agreement or acceptance in a casual way. It doesn't show any strong emotion but rather a laid-back attitude.

Putting it all together: The speaker is using laughter emojis and making a humorous comment without any signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise. Instead, the tone is positive and light-hearted, so the emotion here is joy.
