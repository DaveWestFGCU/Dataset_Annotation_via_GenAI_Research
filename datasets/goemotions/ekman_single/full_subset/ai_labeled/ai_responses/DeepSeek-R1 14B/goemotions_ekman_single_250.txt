Alright, let me try to figure out what emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The sentence is: "> and no one but angry community fanboys have pushed back against his statements." 

First, I notice that the speaker is talking about "angry community fanboys" who are pushing back against someone's statements. Using the word "angry" here suggests that the speaker perceives these individuals as being hostile or confrontational.

Next, looking at the emotion categories provided: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral. I need to determine which one fits best.

The sentence isn't expressing the speaker's own emotions directly, but rather describing others' reactions. However, sometimes the way people describe others can reflect their own feelings. In this case, labeling the fanboys as "angry" might indicate that the speaker feels some frustration or shares the sentiment they're attributing to the fanboys.

But wait, could it be something else? Let's check each emotion:

- Anger: The mention of "angry" here is about others, but if the speaker is agreeing or expressing their own feelings through describing others, this might fit.
- Disgust: Usually involves revulsion towards something unpleasant. Not sure that's present here.
- Fear: Doesn't seem to be about fear; it's more about confrontation.
- Joy: Unlikely since the context is negative.
- Sadness: No indication of sorrow or disappointment.
- Surprise: The statement isn't unexpected in a surprising way.
- Neutral: The speaker is clearly expressing something, so not neutral.

Considering all this, I think "anger" makes sense. The speaker might be aligning with the fanboys' anger or expressing their own frustration by highlighting others' anger.

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment says: "> and no one but angry community fanboys have pushed back against his statements."

First, let me break down the sentence. The speaker is talking about a situation where someone made some statements, and only "angry community fanboys" are pushing back against them. The use of the word "angry" here suggests that the speaker perceives these fanboys as being angry or perhaps acting out of anger.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral. I need to pick one based on the definitions provided.

So, the speaker is pointing out that only angry people are pushing back. That could imply a couple of things. Maybe the speaker feels that the opposition is coming from a group known for being angry, or perhaps the speaker themselves is frustrated with how these fanboys are reacting.

I don't see any words in the comment that express joy, fear, disgust, surprise, or sadness directly. The focus is on the anger of others. However, sometimes when people talk about others' emotions, they might be reflecting their own feelings. So if the speaker refers to the fanboys as "angry," maybe they are acknowledging that the opposition is coming from an angry group, but it doesn't necessarily mean the speaker is feeling angry themselves.

Wait, but could there be a hint of frustration or disapproval? If the speaker is pointing out that only these angry fanboys are reacting, perhaps they feel that the responses are overblown or negative. That might lean towards disgust, which involves strong disapproval. Alternatively, if the speaker feels that others are being too angry, it could also be a form of disapproval.

Alternatively, maybe the speaker is agreeing with the statement and is frustrated because only these fanboys are reacting. But without more context, it's hard to tell.

Looking at the emotion definitions again:

- Anger: Strong feeling of displeasure or antagonism.
- Disgust: Revulsion or strong disapproval.
- Fear: Being afraid or worried.
- Joy: Pleasure and happiness.
- Sadness: Emotional pain.
- Surprise: Astonishment.
- Neutral: No emotion.

The comment doesn't express the speaker's own feelings but describes others as angry. So it's a bit tricky because we have to infer based on context.

If I were to think about this, sometimes when people mention others being angry, they might be expressing their own frustration or agreement with that anger. But in this case, the speaker is saying that only these fanboys are pushing back, implying perhaps that others aren't as vocal. So maybe the speaker is pointing out that the criticism comes from a specific group known for being angry.

I think the emotion here is more about the description of others rather than the speaker's own emotion. However, since the options require choosing an emotion the speaker may be feeling, I might have to consider if the speaker is expressing their own view on the situation, which could include frustration or disapproval.

Given that, perhaps disgust fits because the speaker is disapproving of how these fanboys are reacting. Alternatively, maybe the speaker feels anger towards the statements made by the person being pushed back against, but it's unclear.

But I think the most fitting emotion here would be neutral because the comment doesn't explicitly express the speaker's own feelings; they're describing others as angry. However, since the options don't include "describing others' emotions," I have to choose based on what the speaker might feel.

Alternatively, if the speaker is frustrated with the fanboys' reactions, that could be anger. Or if they disapprove of their behavior, that's disgust.

Hmm. It's a bit ambiguous, but considering the context, perhaps the speaker doesn't express any emotion themselves but is just pointing out the situation. So maybe neutral is appropriate because there's no clear indication of the speaker's own feelings.

Wait, but the comment starts with "> and no one but angry community fanboys have pushed back against his statements." The ">" suggests a quote or reply, so it's in response to something else. Maybe the speaker is agreeing that only these fanboys are reacting, possibly because they're the only ones who care enough to push back, which could imply approval.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the speaker is frustrated with how these fanboys are behaving, leading them to express disgust at their actions.

After considering all this, I think the emotion might be either anger or disgust, but since the speaker isn't directly expressing their own feelings but rather describing others as angry, it's more about pointing out a situation. Therefore, perhaps the emotion is neutral because there's no clear indication of how the speaker feels beyond stating that only these fanboys are reacting.

But wait, in the examples provided for each emotion, sometimes people express emotions by talking about others' actions. For example, in anger examples, they mention others being angry or using strong language. So maybe if someone refers to others as "angry," it could be reflecting their own frustration or agreement with that anger.

In this case, perhaps the speaker is frustrated with how these fanboys are acting, which would fall under anger. Or maybe the speaker is pointing out that only the angry ones are reacting, implying that they themselves aren't part of that group and might not agree with the statements.

I think it's more likely that the speaker is highlighting that the pushback comes from a specific (angry) group, possibly indicating their own disapproval or frustration. So maybe disgust fits because they're disapproving of how these fanboys are reacting.

Alternatively, if the speaker agrees with the statements being pushed back against, then they might be frustrated with the fanboys' anger, which would be anger on their part.

But without more context, it's hard to tell. I think the safest choice here is to go with anger because the speaker refers to others as "angry," possibly indicating that they are aware of or perhaps sharing that sentiment.

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is: "> and no one but angry community fanboys have pushed back against his statements." 

First, let's break down the sentence. The speaker is talking about a situation where someone made statements, and only "angry community fanboys" are pushing back. The key words here are "angry" and "pushed back."

The word "angry" directly refers to anger, but I need to consider if there's more context or emotion implied by the speaker. The speaker is pointing out that it's only these angry people who are reacting negatively. This could indicate a few things: maybe the speaker is frustrated with how others are responding, or perhaps they're agreeing with the original statements and think only fanboys are against them.

Looking at the emotion definitions, anger includes annoyance and disapproval. The speaker seems to be highlighting that only the angry ones are pushing back, which might suggest that the speaker themselves is either annoyed by this behavior or agrees that it's coming from an angry group. However, the use of "angry" here could also imply that the speaker is pointing out the anger in others, not necessarily expressing their own emotion.

But wait, sometimes when people describe others as being angry, they might be projecting their own feelings. Alternatively, the speaker could be frustrated or annoyed by the fact that only these fanboys are reacting this way. So it's a bit ambiguous whether the speaker is feeling anger themselves or just describing others as angry.

Looking at other emotion categories: disgust would involve revulsion, which doesn't seem to fit here. Fear involves worry or anxiety, not present. Joy and surprise aren't indicated. Sadness might come into play if there's disappointment, but that's not clear either. Neutral is when no emotion is expressed, but the mention of "angry" suggests some emotional content.

I think the speaker is using "angry" to describe others, but since they are pointing out this anger in response to someone else's statements, it might reflect their own frustration or disapproval. So the emotion here would likely be anger because they're highlighting that only angry people are reacting negatively, possibly implying they disagree with such a reaction.

Therefore, the most relevant emotion is anger.
