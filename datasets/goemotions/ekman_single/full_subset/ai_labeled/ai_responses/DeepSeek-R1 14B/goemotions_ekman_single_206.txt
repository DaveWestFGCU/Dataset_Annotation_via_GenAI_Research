Alright, let me try to figure out the emotion behind this comment. The speaker says, "I remember when two captured ISIS members were discovered to have ordered a book called '[RELIGION] for dummies' from Amazon." 

First, I need to understand the context. ISIS is a group known for extremist views, so capturing ISIS members might be a sensitive situation. Ordering a book like "[RELIGION] for Dummies" seems unusual because it's typically a light-hearted or introductory guide. The humor here comes from the contrast between ISIS members and someone reading a "for dummies" book, which is meant to simplify complex topics.

The speaker uses this memory as an example, likely to point out something ironic or absurd. This kind of irony often evokes amusement. Since the emotion categories include joy (which includes amusement), that seems like a fit. There's no sign of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise—just a light-hearted take on the situation.

I should also consider if there's any underlying emotion. The speaker isn't expressing strong feelings like anger or disgust towards ISIS; instead, they're highlighting an amusing event. So, the most appropriate emotion here is joy because of the humorous and amused tone.

**joy**

Alright, let me try to figure out which emotion this comment is expressing. The speaker says, "I remember when two captured ISIS members were discovered to have ordered a book called '[RELIGION] for dummies' from Amazon." Hmm.

First, I need to understand the context. ISIS members are being talked about here—they're in captivity. The fact that they ordered a book titled "[RELIGION] for Dummies" might be seen as ironic or surprising. 

The emotion categories are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or neutral. Let's consider each:

- **Anger**: The comment doesn't express frustration or dislike; it's more of an observation.
- **Disgust**: There's no indication of revulsion towards the book or ISIS members.
- **Fear**: No feelings of worry or nervousness are present.
- **Joy**: This doesn't seem happy or celebratory.
- **Sadness**: There's no sorrow or disappointment expressed.
- **Surprise**: The situation is unexpected and might be seen as ironic, which can cause surprise.
- **Neutral**: It's an observation without clear emotion.

The key here is the use of "for dummies," which implies a simple or introductory guide. ISIS members ordering such a book could be considered ironic because they're supposed to have religious knowledge. This irony might catch someone off guard, leading to surprise.

I think the emotion here is **surprise** because it's an unexpected and possibly amusing situation.

The speaker is likely expressing **surprise** due to the unexpected and ironic nature of ISIS members ordering a "for dummies" book.

**emotion**: **surprise**

Alright, so I need to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their Reddit comment. The comment is: "I remember when two captured ISIS members were discovered to have ordered a book called [RELIGION] for dummies from Amazon." 

First, let me analyze the content of the statement. The speaker is recalling an event where ISIS members ordered a book about a religion that they probably don't practice or respect, given the term "for dummies" which might imply it's seen as simplistic or for beginners.

Now, looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral. I need to determine which one fits best.

Anger is about displeasure or antagonism. The speaker doesn't seem angry here; they're just recounting an event without clear negative language towards ISIS members.

Disgust involves revulsion or strong disapproval. The fact that ISIS members ordered a book about a different religion might be seen as absurd or distasteful, which could lead to disgust. But the tone isn't explicitly expressing disgust.

Fear is about being afraid or worried. There's no indication of fear in this statement; it's more of an observation rather than something fearful.

Joy involves pleasure and happiness. The comment doesn't express any positive emotions.

Sadness relates to emotional pain or sorrow. Again, there's no clear sadness here—it’s a factual recounting without negative emotion.

Surprise is about being astonished by something unexpected. Ordering a "for dummies" book could be seen as unexpected or absurd, which might lead someone to feel surprised. The speaker seems to find the situation notable enough to mention, possibly because it's an unusual occurrence.

Neutral would mean no expressed emotion, but the comment does seem to convey some reaction—probably surprise because of the unexpectedness.

So, considering all this, I think the emotion here is surprise. The speaker is highlighting something that might be unexpected or unbelievable about ISIS members ordering such a book.
