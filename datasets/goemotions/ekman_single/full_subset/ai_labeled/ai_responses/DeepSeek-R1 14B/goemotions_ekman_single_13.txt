Alright, let me try to figure out what emotion the speaker is conveying with their comment. The sentence they used is: "It’s ironically calling British people ugly as a meme i guess." 

First, I need to break down this statement. They're mentioning that something is "ironically" calling British people ugly as a meme. Using "ironically" suggests that there's a twist or a contrast between what's being said and the context. Since it's a meme, which is often meant for humor or satire, the speaker might be pointing out that someone else's joke or statement about the British being ugly isn't meant to be taken seriously.

The tone here doesn't seem to show strong emotions like anger or disgust. There's no obvious indication of fear or sadness either. The word "ironically" implies a bit of surprise or unexpectedness, but in this context, it might just be highlighting that the meme is using irony rather than expressing genuine shock.

Looking at the emotion categories: 

- Anger would involve strong dislike, which isn't evident here.
- Disgust would relate to revulsion, but again, not present.
- Fear or surprise are possible, but "ironically" doesn't seem to convey fear; it's more about pointing out a humorous contrast.
- Joy is about happiness, which might be if the speaker finds it amusing, but that's a stretch since they're just explaining the meme's intent.
- Sadness isn't indicated either.
- Neutral would mean no emotion, but "ironically" adds some nuance.

So, considering all this, the most fitting emotion here is surprise. The speaker is acknowledging that something unexpected or ironic is being presented as a meme, which might catch someone off guard, hence the use of "ironically." 

Wait, though—am I overcomplicating it? Maybe the speaker isn't expressing their own emotion but explaining the meme's content. That could mean they're neutral. But given that "ironically" is used, it's more about pointing out an unexpected twist in the meme's message rather than being neutral.

Hmm, perhaps surprise isn't the right choice then. If the speaker is merely stating a fact about the meme's nature without expressing their own feelings, maybe it's neutral after all. But since they're using "ironically," which implies a bit of astonishment or unexpectedness in how the meme presents its message, it leans more towards surprise.

No, wait again—since it's about explaining that the meme is ironic and not meant to be taken seriously, the speaker isn't expressing personal emotion but rather analyzing the meme. Therefore, their own emotion might be neutral as they're just conveying information without emotional charge.

I think I'm oscillating between surprise and neutral here. But based on the definitions, if it's about pointing out something unexpected in a humorous way, maybe surprise is better. Alternatively, since the speaker isn't expressing their own feelings but explaining someone else's content, perhaps it's neutral.

The speaker is analyzing the meme's use of irony without expressing personal emotion, so the most fitting label is **neutral**. 

**Answer:** *After reconsidering, I realize the speaker isn't expressing their own emotions but rather explaining the meme's nature. Thus, the emotion is **neutral**.*

**Final Answer:**
The emotion expressed by the speaker in the comment "It’s ironically calling British people ugly as a meme i guess" is best categorized as **neutral**, as they are providing an explanation without conveying personal feelings.

**Final Answer:** **neutral**

Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is: "It’s ironicallly calling British people ugly as a meme i guess." 

First, let's break down what they're saying. They mention something being ironic—specifically, that someone is using a meme to call British people ugly. The word "ironically" suggests that there's some unexpectedness or contradiction here. Maybe the speaker is pointing out that it's hypocritical or amusingly contradictory for a meme to make such an assertion.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral. I need to choose one.

The comment doesn't express any strong negative emotions like anger or disgust. It also isn't expressing worry or fear. There's no obvious sign of happiness or sadness either. The use of "ironically" makes me think that the speaker is highlighting something unexpected or perhaps a bit absurd, which might be surprising to others.

So, when someone points out an irony in a situation, it often comes with an element of surprise because it reveals something unexpected. In this case, the speaker is pointing out that a meme is making a claim that's ironic—maybe because it's coming from someone who shouldn't be making such judgments or because it's contradictory.

Therefore, I think the emotion here is surprise.

Alright, let me try to figure out which emotion this speaker might be feeling. The sentence given is: "It’s ironically calling British people ugly as a meme i guess." 

First, I need to break down the sentence and look for emotional cues. The word "ironically" stands out here. Irony often suggests that there's a contrast between what's said and what's meant, or perhaps something unexpected. In this context, the speaker is pointing out that someone is using a meme to call British people ugly in an ironic way.

Now, considering the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral. Let's see which fits best.

- **Anger**: The sentence doesn't express strong dislike or irritation directly. It's more about pointing out something rather than being angry.
- **Disgust**: Disgust usually involves revulsion or strong disapproval. While the meme is negative, the speaker is using "ironically," which might not show direct disgust but more of an observation.
- **Fear**: There's no indication of fear or worry here.
- **Joy**: Doesn't seem like joy; it's a negative statement about people being called ugly.
- **Sadness**: Sadness involves emotional pain, and while the meme is negative, the speaker isn't expressing personal sadness.
- **Surprise**: The use of "ironically" suggests that the situation might be unexpected or not what was intended. Irony can often lead to surprise because it's a twist on expectations.

So, putting it together, the speaker is pointing out an ironic meme. They're highlighting the unexpectedness of calling people ugly for comedic effect. This makes me think they're expressing surprise because the action (calling British people ugly) is presented in an ironic way, which might be unexpected or amusing to them.
