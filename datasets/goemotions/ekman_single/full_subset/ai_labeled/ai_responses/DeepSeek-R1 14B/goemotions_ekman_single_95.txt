Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The sentence is: "Would be fun if our sun was like this :3". 

First, I'll break down the sentence. The speaker is talking about a scenario where their sun behaves in a certain way that they find fun. They use an emoticon with a 3, which is often associated with being cute or playful.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral. I need to choose one of these.

The sentence expresses something enjoyable and amusing. The speaker seems to be imagining a fun situation, maybe something unusual or hypothetical about the sun doing something entertaining. The use of ":3" adds to this playful tone.

Joy is associated with pleasure and happiness, which fits here because the speaker is expressing that the scenario would be funâ€”clearly a positive emotion. There's no sign of any negative emotions like anger or sadness; it's more light-hearted.

I don't think it's surprise because they're not reacting to something unexpected but rather imagining a fun scenario. Fear and disgust are also out of place here. Neutral is when there's no emotion, but the speaker clearly has a positive feeling.

So, putting it all together, the emotion is joy.

Alright, so I need to figure out what emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is: "Would be fun if our sun was like this :3". Let me break it down.

First, looking at the sentence structure and the context. They're talking about the sun being a certain way, which sounds hypothetical or fictional. The use of ":3" is an emoticon that typically represents happiness or playfulness. So, the speaker seems to be expressing a light-hearted or amusing thought.

Now, considering the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or neutral. I need to pick the most relevant one.

The comment doesn't show any signs of anger, disgust, fear, or sadness. There's no indication of negative emotions. Surprise is about astonishment, which isn't really there either because they're making a hypothetical statement in a playful tone. Neutral would mean no emotion, but the emoticon suggests some feeling.

Therefore, joy seems appropriate here because the speaker is expressing something fun and positive, using an emoticon that conveys happiness.

The speaker uses an emoticon indicating playfulness and mentions something fun hypothetically. This reflects a positive, joyful tone.
