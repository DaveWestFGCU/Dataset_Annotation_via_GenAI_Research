Alright, let me try to figure out what emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment says, "Done it since I was a kid I was very edgy." 

First, I need to break down the sentence. The speaker mentions doing something since they were a kid and describes themselves as "very edgy." Now, "edgy" typically refers to someone who is bold or unconventional, often implying a sense of coolness or non-conformity.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral. I have to choose one that best fits here.

- Anger: The speaker doesn't seem angry. They're talking about their past and personality.
- Disgust: There's no indication of revulsion or disapproval.
- Fear: No signs of worry or anxiety mentioned.
- Joy: While being edgy can be positive, "edgy" itself isn't directly a joyful emotion but more about attitude.
- Sadness: Doesn't seem to apply here; the tone doesn't suggest sorrow.
- Surprise: The comment is straightforward and not unexpected.
- Neutral: Maybe, since it's an informative statement without strong emotion.

But wait, "edgy" can sometimes carry a hint of amusement or self-deprecating humor. Maybe the speaker is expressing a bit of pride or enjoyment in being edgy. That might lean towards joy, as joy includes admiration and approval.

However, considering that "edgy" is more about personality than an emotion, the comment could be neutral. But if there's any positive feeling behind it, it might be joy.

I think the best fit is **joy** because expressing being edgy might indicate a sense of pride or self-amusement.

Alright, let me try to figure out what emotion this comment is conveying. The speaker says, "Done it since I was a kid I was very edgy." Hmm. So they're talking about something they've been doing since childhood and describe themselves as "edgy."

First, let's break down the words. "Edgy" usually refers to someone who is bold, unconventional, or maybe even a bit risky. It can also imply a sense of coolness or uniqueness. In this context, it's likely the speaker is expressing pride or satisfaction in their edginess.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral. I need to pick one that fits best. 

- Anger? Doesn't seem like it. No signs of frustration or irritation here.
- Disgust? Not really, since they're not expressing aversion or revulsion.
- Fear? There's no indication of worry or anxiety.
- Joy? This could fit because "edgy" often comes with a positive self-image. The speaker might be happy about their uniqueness.
- Sadness? Doesn't seem to apply here; the tone isn't somber or mournful.
- Surprise? No, it's more of a statement than something unexpected.
- Neutral? Well, they are expressing an emotion by saying "edgy," so probably not neutral.

So, considering all that, joy seems like the best fit. The speaker is likely feeling proud or happy about being edgy since childhood. They might be sharing this to convey their personality positively or to connect with others who appreciate edginess.

Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion that the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The sentence given is: "Done it since I was a kid I was very edgy." 

First, let me break down what this sentence is saying. The speaker is talking about an action they've been doing since childhood and describes themselves as "very edgy." The word "edgy" typically means someone who is bold, daring, or unconventional, often pushing boundaries. It can also imply a sense of rebellion or non-conformity.

Now, looking at the emotion categories provided: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral. I need to pick one that best fits here.

- Anger doesn't seem right because there's no indication of frustration or irritation in the statement.
- Disgust is about revulsion, which isn't evident either.
- Fear involves anxiety or worry, but again, there's nothing pointing towards that.
- Joy would involve happiness or pleasure, but "edgy" doesn't necessarily convey joy unless it's about enjoying being edgy. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.
- Sadness is about sorrow or disappointment; no signs of that.
- Surprise implies astonishment, which isn't really there either.
- Neutral would be if there's no emotion expressed.

Wait, but "edgy" could imply a certain level of confidence or perhaps even defiance. Does that translate to any specific emotion? Maybe not directly into the given categories. The speaker is just stating a fact about themselves being edgy since childhood. There's an air of self-assurance here, almost pride in being edgy. However, "pride" falls under joy, but I'm not sure if that's the intended emotion.

Alternatively, maybe "edgy" could be interpreted as a bit of rebellion or non-conformity, which might lean towards anger or defiance, but again, it's more about attitude than an explicit emotion.

Considering all this, the statement is factual and descriptive. The speaker isn't expressing a strong emotion like anger or joy; they're just stating how they've been since childhood. So, perhaps the most fitting category is neutral because there's no overt display of any specific emotion beyond a self-descriptive term.
