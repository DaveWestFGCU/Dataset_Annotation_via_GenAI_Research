Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is: "Great game, great soundtrack. He was like 19 or 20 when he did that too." Alright, let's break this down.

First, looking at the words used, they're using positive adjectives like "great" which immediately makes me think of joy because those are happy words. They're complimenting both the game and the soundtrack, so that's a good sign pointing towards a positive emotion.

Then, the second part of the sentence adds some context: mentioning that the person was young (19 or 20) when they did something impressive. This could be expressing admiration or appreciation for someone's talent at a young age. Admiration is definitely linked with joy because it's a form of positive reinforcement and happiness.

I should also consider other emotions to make sure I'm not missing anything. Anger? Doesn't seem like it; the words are positive. Disgust? No, they're not expressing any dislike or revulsion. Fear? There's no indication of worry or nervousness here. Sadness? Again, nothing negative stands out.

Could it be surprise? Well, surprise is about being astonished by something unexpected. Here, the speaker is making a complimentary statement but isn't expressing anything that would indicate astonishment or realization. It seems more like a straightforward praise rather than something surprising.

Neutral? No, because they're definitely expressing positive feelings. So between joy and maybe surprise or neutral, but I think joy fits better here because of the praise and admiration.

So putting it all together, the emotion is likely joy because of the positive comments about the game and soundtrack, along with the appreciation for someone's work at a young age.

The speaker is expressing positive feelings towards the game and its soundtrack, using words like "great," which indicates joy. They also show admiration for the person's accomplishment at a young age.

Alright, so I need to figure out the emotion behind this Reddit comment: "Great game, great soundtrack. He was like 19 or 20 when he did that too." The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or neutral.

Let me break it down. The first part of the comment is "Great game, great soundtrack." That sounds positive. Using words like "great" usually indicates approval or satisfaction, which points towards a positive emotion. So, joy might be a possibility because joy includes admiration and approval.

Then the speaker adds more information: "He was like 19 or 20 when he did that too." This part seems to be providing additional context or maybe expressing surprise about the age of the person involved. The use of "like" here is conversational, but it doesn't necessarily carry an emotion on its own. However, considering the first part was positive and this adds another layer by mentioning youth, it might imply that the speaker finds it impressive or surprising that someone so young did something great.

Looking at the emotion definitions: Joy includes admiration, which fits with praising the game and soundtrack. Surprise includes astonishment or realization, which could come from being surprised at the age. But the main emotion seems to be positive praise rather than surprise, even though the age might add an element of that.

I think the primary emotion here is joy because the speaker is clearly expressing approval and happiness about the game and soundtrack. The mention of the person's age adds context but doesn't change the overall tone from positive to something else.

Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment says, "Great game, great soundtrack. He was like 19 or 20 when he did that too." Let me break this down.

First, looking at the first part: "Great game, great soundtrack." That sounds positive. Using words like "great" usually indicates approval or happiness. So that makes me think of joy because they're expressing pleasure and satisfaction with the game and its music.

Then, the second part adds context about the person's age when he did it: "He was like 19 or 20 when he did that too." This seems to be an observation or maybe admiration for someone doing something impressive at a young age. It doesn't show any negative emotions; instead, it complements him.

Looking back at the emotion definitions:

- Anger isn't here because there's no sign of displeasure.
- Disgust is absent since they're not showing revulsion.
- Fear isn't present either as there's no indication of worry or anxiety.
- Sadness doesn't fit because there's nothing sorrowful in the message.
- Surprise might be a thought, but it's more about positive acknowledgment rather than astonishment.
- Neutral is out because emotions are clearly expressed.

So, putting it all together, the speaker seems to be expressing joy through their positive comments and admiration for the person's achievement at a young age. Therefore, the emotion here should be joy.
