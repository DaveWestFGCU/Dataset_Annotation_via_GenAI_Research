Okay, I need to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is: "Depay being a flop at United comes to mind, so good now." 

First, let's break down what this sentence means. Depay refers to Memphis Depay, a footballer who once played for Manchester United. The speaker mentions that Depay was considered a flop during his time there but notes that he is "so good now," which I assume means he's performing well elsewhere now.

So, the speaker is contrasting Depay's past performance at United with his current success. Now, what emotion does this convey? 

Looking at the definitions:
- Anger: This would involve strong displeasure or antagonism, maybe if the speaker was upset about Depay's past.
- Disgust: Revulsion towards something unpleasant; not sure if that fits here.
- Fear: Worry or nervousnessâ€”doesn't seem applicable.
- Joy: Happiness or pleasure. The speaker seems to recognize Depay's improvement, which could be positive.
- Sadness: Emotional pain, perhaps related to disappointment but the tone isn't sad.
- Surprise:astonishment at something unexpected. The comment is somewhat factual rather than surprising.
- Neutral: No emotion expressed.

The phrase "so good now" suggests approval or positive recognition of Depay's current performance, which aligns with joy. However, the speaker also acknowledges that Depay was a flop before, but without expressing any negative emotion towards it. It seems more like an observation rather than a strong feeling. 

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The comment is pointing out that someone who was once seen negatively (a flop) is now successful. The speaker might be expressing approval or happiness about Depay's current success, which fits with joy. Alternatively, they could just be stating facts without emotion, making it neutral.

But considering the context of Reddit comments, people often express their feelings, so "joy" seems more likely because the speaker is highlighting Depay's improvement positively.

Okay, I need to figure out which emotion the speaker might be feeling based on their comment. The comment is: "Depay being a flop at United comes to mind, so good now." Let me break this down.

First, the mention of Depay being a flop suggests that something didn't go well for him at Manchester United. Flopping usually implies underperformance or not meeting expectations. Then, the speaker says "so good now," which seems like they're noting that Depay is performing better recently.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral.

I don't see signs of anger here because it's more about stating a fact rather than expressing frustration. Disgust doesn't fit either; the comment isn't about something unpleasant or offensive. Fear is unlikely as there's no indication of worry or anxiety. Sadness also doesn't seem applicable because there's no sorrow expressed.

Joy could be a possibility if the speaker is happy about Depay's improvement, but I'm not sure that's the primary emotion here. Surprise might fit if the speaker is taken aback by how well Depay is doing now. Alternatively, maybe it's more of an observation without strong emotion, making neutral possible.

Wait, "so good now" could imply recognition or approval of his current performance. That leans towards joy because they're happy about his improvement. But considering the context on Reddit, sometimes these comments are more about pointing out contrasts rather than expressing personal happiness.

Alternatively, maybe the speaker is surprised that Depay has turned things around. So surprise might be the emotion here because it's unexpected that he's doing well now after being a flop.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between joy and surprise. But since the comment highlights a significant change from flop to good, which might catch someone off guard, surprise seems more fitting.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to identify the emotion someone is feeling based on their comment. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or neutral.

First, I'll look at the comment: "Depay being a flop at United comes to mind, so good now." Hmm, okay. So Depay refers to Memphis Depay, a footballer who had some struggles during his time at Manchester United. The speaker is pointing out that Depay was considered a flop there but is doing well now.

I need to analyze the sentiment here. The phrase "Depay being a flop" likely reflects on his past performance which didn't meet expectations. However, the second part says "so good now," indicating improvement or a positive change in his situation.

Now, considering the emotion categories:

1. **Anger**: Usually involves displeasure or antagonism. I don't see signs of that here.
2. **Disgust**: Involves revulsion or strong disapproval. The comment isn't expressing dislike but rather a contrast between past and present performance.
3. **Fear**: Includes anxiety or worry. There's no indication of fear in the statement.
4. **Joy**: Happiness, pleasure. While the speaker mentions Depay doing well now, it's more about acknowledging improvement rather than personal joy.
5. **Sadness**: Emotional pain or sorrow. The mention of being a flop could imply some disappointment, but again, not sadness itself.
6. **Surprise**:astonishment at something unexpected. If someone is highlighting an unexpected turn-around, this might fit.
7. **Neutral**: No emotion expressed.

Wait, the comment seems to be pointing out that despite Depay's past failure, he's now successful. The speaker isn't expressing their own emotions directly but is presenting a contrast. So, perhaps they're surprised by his improvement because it wasn't expected. Alternatively, it could just be an informative statement without emotion, making it neutral.

I think the key here is whether the speaker is expressing their own feelings or stating facts. Since it's a Reddit comment in response to another post or commenter, it's likely sharing an observation rather than expressing personal emotion. Therefore, the emotion might be neutral.

The speaker is pointing out that despite Depay's past struggles at United, he is now performing well. This statement is more observational and factual, lacking clear emotional expression.

Alright, let me try to figure out the emotion behind this comment. The user wrote: "Depay being a flop at United comes to mind, so good now." 

First, I need to understand the context. It seems like they're talking about Memphis Depay, a footballer who moved to Manchester United. They mention he was a flop there but is doing well now. 

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral.

The speaker is pointing out that someone didn't perform well initially but has since improved. This sounds more like approval or positive feelings towards Depay's turnaround. However, the options don't include approval directly; the closest would be joy because it includes admiration and approval. 

But wait, could there be any other emotion? Maybe surprise if they're highlighting an unexpected turn of events. But the tone seems more affirmative than surprised.

Alternatively, is there any sign of anger or disgust? The mention of Depay being a flop might imply criticism, but the overall message seems to support his current success, so it's not negative.

Therefore, the emotion here leans towards joy because they're happy about his improvement.

The speaker expresses approval and positivity regarding Depay's improvement, indicating admiration and a positive sentiment. 

**joy**
