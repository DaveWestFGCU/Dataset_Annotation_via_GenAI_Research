Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is "You’re mean." Let me start by understanding what each emotion entails.

First, anger is when someone feels strong displeasure or antagonism. Disgust is revulsion or disapproval towards something unpleasant. Fear involves being afraid or worried. Joy is happiness or pleasure. Sadness is emotional pain or sorrow. Surprise is feeling astonished or unexpected. Neutral means no clear emotion.

The comment "You’re mean" seems to express disapproval. The speaker is calling someone out for being unkind. That fits into the category of disgust because it's a strong disapproval towards another person's behavior. Anger could also be possible, but anger usually involves more intense feelings like hate or annoyance. Disgust here aligns with feeling that something is offensive or unpleasant about the other person's meanness.

I don't think it's fear because there's no indication of being afraid. Sadness would involve more sorrow, which isn't present here. Surprise would require something unexpected, but "you're mean" is a direct statement rather than surprising. Neutral doesn't apply because there is an expressed emotion.

So, the most fitting emotion is disgust.

Alright, let's try to figure out what emotion the speaker might be feeling when they say "You're mean." So, first, I need to understand the context. The speaker is responding to someone else on Reddit, probably in a comment section.

The phrase "You're mean" can have different emotional tones depending on how it's delivered and the surrounding conversation. But generally, calling someone "mean" often indicates some level of frustration or disapproval. 

Looking at the emotion categories: anger includes annoyance and disapproval, which seems to fit here. The speaker is expressing that they don't like what the other person said or did, which can stem from anger.

I should consider if it could be another emotion. Disgust is more about revulsion, but "mean" isn't necessarily something that would disgust someone unless there's a strong dislike based on offensive behavior. However, in this case, it's more about the action being mean rather than something physically disgusting.

Fear involves feeling afraid or worried, which doesn't seem to apply here. The speaker is reacting to another person's actions, not expressing fear. Joy and surprise are clearly out of the question because "You're mean" isn't a positive or surprising statement.

Sadness could be possible if the speaker feels hurt, but the direct reaction here seems more about disapproval rather than sorrow. Neutral is when there's no emotion, which isn't the case here because the speaker is clearly reacting.

So, putting it all together, the most relevant emotion is anger because the speaker is showing disapproval and frustration towards someone else being mean.

Okay, I need to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is "You're mean." Let me break this down.

First, looking at the emotion categories provided, I should consider each one and see which fits best. The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or neutral.

The phrase "You're mean" suggests that the speaker is expressing disapproval towards someone else's actions or words. Being called mean typically relates to someone being perceived as harsh, unkind, or cruel. 

Looking at the emotion definitions:
- Anger involves displeasure or antagonism, which can include annoyance.
- Disgust is about revulsion or strong disapproval, often towards something unpleasant.

In this case, "You're mean" seems to convey both dislike and perhaps a bit of irritation. While it could be interpreted as anger because of the negative tone, I should also consider if it's more disgust because it's a strong disapproval. However, in most cases where someone is labeled as mean, it often evokes a feeling of anger rather than pure disgust.

Wait, but sometimes being called mean can also feel like an insult that causes offense, which might lean towards disgust. But I think the primary emotion here is more likely anger because "You're mean" is a direct criticism that could stir up irritation or annoyance, both of which fall under anger.

I should also consider if there's any indication of other emotions like fear or surprise. There's no context suggesting fear or surprise in this statement; it's straightforward disapproval.

So, putting it all together, the emotion most likely is anger because the speaker is expressing dislike and possibly irritation towards someone being mean.
