Okay, I need to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is: "It also makes me cry! but because it shows how far [NAME] has fallen..." 

First, let's break down what they're saying. They mention crying, which often relates to sadness or maybe even other emotions like joy, but in this context, crying because someone has fallen suggests a negative emotion. The phrase "how far [NAME] has fallen" implies that the speaker is disappointed or disheartened by [NAME]'s situation.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger involves displeasure or antagonism, disgust is about revulsion, fear is anxiety or worry, joy is happiness, sadness is pain or sorrow, surprise is astonishment, and neutral is no emotion. 

Crying can be a sign of sadness, but it's also possible in other contexts. However, the context here is someone's fall from what was expected—this sounds like disappointment, which falls under sadness. The speaker isn't expressing anger towards [NAME], nor are they disgusted or fearful. They're reacting to the negative outcome of someone else's situation, which leads them to cry out of sorrow.

So, considering all this, the emotion here is likely sadness.

Alright, so I need to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The sentence given is: "It also makes me cry! but because it shows how far [NAME] has fallen..." Let me break this down.

First, the speaker mentions that something makes them cry. Crying can be associated with several emotions—sadness being a primary one. But they add, "but because it shows how far [NAME] has fallen." This suggests that their tears are due to seeing someone's decline, which indicates sadness or perhaps disappointment.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger is more about displeasure or antagonism, but there's no indication of dislike here. Disgust involves revulsion, which isn't present either. Fear would involve worry or anxiety, but again, the context doesn't point to that. Joy and surprise are also not fitting because the sentiment isn't positive or astonishment. Neutral is unlikely as they're expressing a strong emotion through tears.

So, considering all this, the emotion is sadness because the speaker is moved to tears by seeing someone's downfall.

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is: "It also makes me cry! but because it shows how far [NAME] has fallen..." 

First, let's break down the sentence. They mention crying, which often relates to sadness or maybe even something else like surprise, but in this context, it seems more about an emotional response to something negative happening.

The second part of the comment says "because it shows how far [NAME] has fallen." This suggests that the speaker is expressing disappointment or sorrow regarding someone's decline. The word "fallen" implies a negative change over time, which is typically associated with sadness rather than other emotions like anger or fear.

Looking at the emotion definitions provided:

- Sadness includes disappointment and grief.
- Disappointment is explicitly part of sadness.

Crying can sometimes be linked to both joy and sadness, but in this case, the context is about someone's downfall, so it leans more towards sadness. There's no indication of anger or disgust here; it's more about the emotional impact of a negative situation.

So, putting it all together, the emotion that best fits is sadness.
