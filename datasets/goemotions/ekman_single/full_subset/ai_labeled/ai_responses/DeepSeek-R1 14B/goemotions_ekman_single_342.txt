Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their Reddit comment. The comment says, "Each season gets better and better with season 3 or something you should go back and see what happened." 

First, let's break down the sentence. They're talking about each season getting better, especially highlighting season 3. Then they suggest that someone should go back and see what happened. This seems like they're recommending something positive or encouraging.

The emotion categories I have to choose from are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and neutral. So, let's analyze the sentence for any clues of these emotions.

The phrase "Each season gets better and better" is definitely a positive statement. The speaker seems to be praising something—maybe a TV show or series. They think each season improves, which shows approval or satisfaction. 

Then they mention specifically that "season 3" stands out, suggesting it's the peak so far. By recommending someone go back and see what happened, they're likely expressing enthusiasm about past seasons, especially season 3. This could indicate joy because they're encouraging others to experience something positive.

Looking at the emotion definitions: Joy includes feelings like approval, admiration, excitement, etc. The speaker seems to be sharing a positive opinion and recommending content they enjoy, which aligns with joy.

I don't think it's anger or disgust because there are no negative words. Fear would involve worry or anxiety, but the comment is encouraging without any signs of fear. Sadness isn't present either; instead, the tone is uplifting. Surprise usually involves unexpected events, but here the recommendation is straightforward. Neutral is ruled out because there's a clear positive sentiment.

So, putting it all together, the emotion conveyed is joy.

First, I'll break down the sentence. The speaker mentions that each season gets better, especially highlighting season 3. They're encouraging someone to go back and watch past seasons. This sounds positive because they're talking about improvement and recommending content they enjoy.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral. I need to pick one. The speaker is clearly expressing something favorable about the TV show or series. They think each season is getting better, which indicates satisfaction or approval. That's a positive emotion, so joy comes to mind because it includes admiration and approval.

I don't see any signs of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise in their words. They're not expressing worry or confusion; instead, they're sharing enthusiasm about the series improving. Neutral isn't applicable here because there's definitely an expressed emotion—positively so.

So, the emotion is joy because the speaker is showing approval and encouraging others to enjoy something they find positive.

Okay, I need to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment says, "Each season gets better and better with season 3 or something you should go back and see what happened." Let me break this down.

First, the speaker mentions that each season gets better, especially pointing out that season 3 is good. They're encouraging someone to go back and watch previous seasons. This sounds positive because they're highlighting improvements and recommending content they enjoy.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger involves displeasure or antagonism, which doesn't fit here. Disgust is about revulsion; again, not applicable. Fear relates to being afraid or worried—no signs of that. Sadness involves emotional pain or sorrow, which also isn't present. Surprise includes astonishment, but there's no unexpected element in the comment.

That leaves joy and neutral. Joy encompasses feelings like happiness and approval. The speaker seems to be sharing something positive they enjoy, suggesting they care about it and are enthusiastic. Their tone is encouraging and appreciative, which aligns with joy.

Neutral would mean no emotion is expressed, but the recommendation suggests a positive feeling. So, I think the emotion here is joy.
