Alright, I'm trying to figure out what emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The sentence given is: "If it weren't already so delayed." 

First, I'll break down the words and context. The phrase starts with a conditional—"If it weren't"—which suggests they're talking about an alternative situation. Then there's "so delayed," indicating that something isn't happening on time or as expected.

Now, considering the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral. Let me think about each one. 

Anger usually involves strong displeasure or antagonism. The comment doesn't show any explicit frustration or hostility, so maybe not anger. Disgust is more about revulsion; there's no indication of that here.

Fear would involve being afraid or worried. The speaker isn't expressing anxiety or fear, just a statement on delay. Joy and surprise are positive emotions, which don't seem to fit. Sadness includes sorrow or disappointment. Maybe, but the comment is more about frustration than sadness.

Wait, "delayed" can imply that something isn't moving forward as it should, which could be frustrating. Frustration is a form of anger, right? But the emotion categories are specific. So, does this fall under anger?

Alternatively, maybe it's neutral because the speaker is simply stating a fact without showing strong emotion. But I think frustration here points towards anger.

So, after considering all options, I think the emotion here is **anger** because the delay might be causing frustration, which is part of anger.

The speaker expresses frustration about something being delayed, indicating displeasure.

Alright, I need to figure out the emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The sentence given is, "If it weren't already so delayed." 

First, I should look at the context. Since this is a Reddit comment, it's likely in response to something someone else posted or another commenter said. Without more context, I'll have to analyze the words themselves.

The phrase "If it weren't already so delayed" suggests that whatever they're talking about (maybe a project, event, or process) has been delayed. The speaker is acknowledging that something is delayed, which could indicate frustration. 

Now, looking at the emotion categories: anger includes frustration and irritation. Disgust might involve revulsion but doesn't seem to fit here. Fear would relate to anxiety or worry, but delay typically doesn't invoke fear unless it's about potential negative outcomes, which isn't clear here. Joy is positive and doesn't apply. Sadness could be related if the delay causes disappointment, but frustration seems more immediate. Surprise would involve astonishment, which isn't indicated.

Considering possible emotions: The speaker might be frustrated because of the delay, so that points to anger. They're not expressing extreme anger, just a mild irritation, but within the given categories, anger is the closest fit. There's no strong indication of other emotions like fear or surprise.

So, I think the emotion here is **anger**.

Okay, I need to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment: "If it weren't already so delayed." The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or neutral.

First, let's break down the sentence. The speaker is talking about something being delayed. Delayed usually implies that there's a wait or postponement involved. Now, considering the emotion categories:

- Anger: This might come into play if the delay is frustrating or intentional. But just saying it's delayed doesn't necessarily indicate anger unless there's more context.
- Disgust: Doesn't seem to fit here because disgust relates to something unpleasant or offensive, not really about delays.
- Fear: Fear involves being afraid or worried. While a delay might cause worry, the speaker isn't expressing fear directly.
- Joy: Unlikely, since joy is about pleasure and happiness, which doesn't align with a delayed situation.
- Sadness: This could be possible if the delay causes disappointment or frustration, which can sometimes lead to sadness.
- Surprise: The comment doesn't indicate anything unexpected, so surprise might not fit.
- Neutral: If the speaker isn't showing any strong emotion, but just stating a fact.

So, the key here is whether the delay is causing negative emotions. Since the speaker mentions it's already delayed, they might be expressing frustration or disappointment, which are related to sadness. Alternatively, if they're simply stating a fact without emotional language, it could be neutral.

But given that delays often lead to feelings like impatience or frustration, which can tie into anger. However, the statement is more about acknowledging the delay rather than expressing intense anger. It might lean towards sadness because of the implications of the delay causing inconvenience or disappointment.

Wait, but sometimes people express frustration when things are delayed, which is a form of anger. The sentence doesn't have strong emotional words though, so it's hard to tell if they're angry or just stating facts. Since there's no explicit emotion, maybe it's neutral.

But I think the most likely emotion here is frustration, which is part of anger. So, considering that, the speaker might be feeling anger due to the delay.

The speaker mentions a delay, which could indicate frustration, aligning with anger.
