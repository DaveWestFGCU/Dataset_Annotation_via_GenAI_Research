Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is: "Then I find writing of us only eating it during winter strange." Let me break this down.

First, I'll look at the words used. They mention finding something "strange," which immediately makes me think about surprise or maybe confusion. But wait, the emotion categories are specific. Surprise includesastonishment, startlement, or realization. Strangeness can lead to surprise because it's unexpected.

Is there any indication of other emotions? Let's see: anger would involve strong displeasure, but there's no explicit frustration or hate here. Disgust is about revulsion, which isn't present either. Fear involves being afraid or worried; I don't sense that tone. Joy is happiness or pleasure, which doesn't fit because the speaker seems perplexed.

Sadness includes sorrow or disappointment. The comment doesn't express sadness but rather confusion. Neutral would mean no emotion, but "strange" implies some reaction. So surprise fits best because they're reacting to something unexpected—writing about eating only during winter is odd to them.

I should also consider the context. Reddit comments can be reactions to posts or other users' comments. If someone wrote that we only eat it in winter, the speaker finds that strange, which likely means they're surprised by this claim or idea.

Putting it all together, the emotion here seems to be surprise.

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is: "Then I find writing of us only eating it during winter strange." 

First, let me break down the sentence. The speaker is talking about someone else's writing, specifically that "us" (probably a group) only eat something during winter. They describe this as "strange." 

Now, looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral.

I don't see any obvious signs of anger here; no strong words or frustration expressed. Disgust would involve finding something repulsive, which isn't clear here. Fear would imply anxiety or worry, but the speaker seems more contemplative than worried. Joy is about happiness, which doesn't seem to fit either.

Sadness involves emotional pain, but again, there's no indication of sorrow or disappointment. Surprise is when something unexpected happens. The comment expresses that the practice is strange, so maybe surprise is a possibility because they're finding it unusual.

Alternatively, "strange" could also be a neutral observation without strong emotion, making neutral a contender.

I'm leaning towards surprise here because calling something strange often implies that it's unexpected or odd, which can indicate surprise. But I'm not entirely sure if the speaker is just stating an observation neutrally.

Wait, in the examples given for surprise, there are instances where people express astonishment or realization. Here, the speaker is pointing out something unusual but doesn't show strong emotions. Maybe it's more neutral because they're just making an observational statement rather than expressing shock or surprise.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between surprise and neutral here. The word "strange" suggests that it's unexpected, which might lean towards surprise, but the speaker isn't showing a strong emotional reaction—they're just stating their finding.

I think I'll go with surprise because "strange" indicates astonishment or that something is not as expected. So, the emotion is **surprise**.

The speaker finds the practice strange, which suggests they are surprised by it.

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion the speaker might be feeling based on their comment. The comment says, "Then I find writing of us only eating it during winter strange." Hmm.

Let me break this down. The speaker is talking about someone else's writing, specifically that "us only eating it during winter" seems strange to them. So they're expressing an opinion about the content. 

Looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral.

First, I don't think it's anger because there's no indication of strong displeasure or antagonism here. They're not attacking or showing hostility.

Disgust is usually about something unpleasant or offensive. The speaker isn't expressing dislike or revulsion; they're just stating that the idea seems strange.

Fear involves being afraid or worried. There's no sense of fear in the comment—they’re not expressing anxiety or nervousness.

Joy would involve pleasure or happiness, which doesn't seem to fit here since the comment is about finding something strange, more of a neutral or maybe slightly critical tone.

Sadness includes emotional pain or sorrow, but again, there’s no indication of that. They're not expressing grief or disappointment.

Surprise involves being astonished or startled by something unexpected. The speaker says it's "strange," which could imply surprise because they found the idea unexpected or unusual.

Neutral is when there's no expressed emotion. However, the use of "strange" suggests some reaction beyond neutrality—so maybe not neutral.

So, putting it together: The speaker is pointing out that something seems strange to them. This indicates a mild form of surprise or astonishment because they're reacting to an unexpected idea or practice described in someone else's writing.
