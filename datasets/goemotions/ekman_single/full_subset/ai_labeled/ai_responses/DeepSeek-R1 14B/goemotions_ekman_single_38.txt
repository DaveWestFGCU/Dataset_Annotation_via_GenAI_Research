Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion the speaker is feeling based on their Reddit comment. The comment is: "Love hearing stories like this. [NAME] holy Priests are such a gift. We must always give thanks and pray for them."

Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I notice that the speaker says they "love" hearing these stories. The word "love" is typically associated with positive emotions, so that might lean towards joy or something similar.

Next, they mention that holy Priests are a "gift." Using the word "gift" implies gratitude and appreciation, which again points to a positive emotion.

Then, the speaker says we should "always give thanks and pray for them." This is expressing thanks and showing respect, which reinforces the idea of a positive feeling.

Looking at the emotion categories provided: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral. The comment doesn't show any signs of being angry, disgusted, afraid, sad, or surprised. It's all about gratitude and love.

So putting it all together, the emotion here is clearly joy because they're expressing love and appreciation.

The speaker expresses love and appreciation, indicating joy.

Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their Reddit comment. The comment is: "Love hearing stories like this. [NAME] holy Priests are such a gift. We must always give thanks and pray for them." 

Let me break it down. The speaker starts with "Love hearing stories like this," which immediately makes me think of joy because they're expressing positive feelings. They mention that holy Priests are a "gift" and talk about giving thanks and praying, which sounds grateful and appreciative. All these words are associated with happiness, approval, and admiration.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger is out because there's no sign of displeasure. Disgust isn't here either since they're not showing revulsion. Fear? No anxiety or worry mentioned. Sadness? They don't seem sorrowful. Surprise? Nothing unexpected is happening. Neutral? Definitely not; they're clearly expressing something.

So, putting it all together, the emotion that fits best is joy.
