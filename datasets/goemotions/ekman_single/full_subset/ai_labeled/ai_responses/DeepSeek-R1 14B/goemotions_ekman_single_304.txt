Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment: "100% yes. My sister's ex is an actual monster but my niece still sees his family." The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or neutral.

First, let me break down the sentence. They start with "100% yes," which sounds like agreement or strong affirmation. Then they say their sister's ex is an "actual monster." That word choice is pretty strongâ€”using "monster" indicates a lot of negative feelings. It shows that the speaker has a very low opinion of this person.

Next, they mention that despite this, the niece still sees his family. This part seems to contrast with the first part. The speaker might be pointing out an inconsistency or something that upsets them about the situation. Maybe they're concerned about the niece's exposure to someone they see as negative.

Looking at the emotion categories:

- Anger: Fits because calling someone a "monster" is a strong expression of dislike, which aligns with anger.
- Disgust: Could also fit if the speaker feels revolted by the ex's actions. But here, it's more about the judgment of the person rather than something physically or morally repugnant.
- Fear: Doesn't seem to apply unless there's an element of threat implied, which isn't clear here.
- Joy/sadness/surprise/neutral: These don't fit because the tone is clearly negative.

So between anger and disgust. The key is that "monster" suggests intense dislike or animosity, which points more towards anger rather than mere disapproval (disgust). So I think anger is the most appropriate emotion here.

Okay, I need to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The text says: "100% yes. My sister's ex is an actual monster but my niece still sees his family." 

First, let me break down the sentence. The speaker starts with strong agreement ("100% yes"), which might indicate a positive emotion like joy or excitement. Then they describe their sister's ex as "an actual monster," which is clearly a negative statement filled with anger and disapproval. This part suggests that the speaker is feeling angry.

The second part of the sentence mentions that despite this, the niece still sees his family. This might imply some concern or worry about the niece's exposure to negative influences, but more prominently, it's the initial strong negative description that stands out. The word "monster" is a strong term indicating intense dislike or anger towards the ex.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger includes annoyance and disapproval, which fits here. Disgust might involve revulsion, but the comment isn't describing something physically gross; it's more about moral wrongdoing. Fear involves being afraid or worried, but the speaker seems to be expressing strong disapproval rather than fear. Sadness is related to emotional pain, but again, the primary emotion here seems to be anger.

So, putting it all together, the most relevant emotion is anger.

Alright, let me try to figure out the emotion here. The user provided a Reddit comment: "100% yes. My sister's ex is an actual monster but my niece still sees his family." I need to determine which emotion from the given list this expresses.

First, looking at the sentence structure and words used. The speaker starts with agreement ("100% yes"), which might indicate some form of positive sentiment or strong feeling. But then they mention their sister's ex as "an actual monster," which is a strong negative descriptor. This suggests anger or perhaps disgust because calling someone a monster can convey intense dislike.

The second part says the niece still sees his family, which implies that despite the negative feelings towards the ex, there's still interaction or recognition from the niece's side. The speaker might be expressing frustration or disapproval about this situation.

Now, considering the emotion categories: anger is defined as strong displeasure or antagonism. Disgust involves revulsion or strong disapproval. Here, the use of "monster" leans more towards anger because it's a direct criticism and shows irritation or resentment.

I don't think it's fear because there's no indication of being afraid. Sadness might come into play if talking about family issues, but the strong negative term points more to anger. Disgust is possible, but the context seems more about disapproval rather than something repulsive.

So, putting it all together, the emotion here is likely anger.
