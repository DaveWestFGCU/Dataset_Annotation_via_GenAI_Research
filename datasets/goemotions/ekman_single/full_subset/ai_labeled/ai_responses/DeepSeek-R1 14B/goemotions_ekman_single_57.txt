Okay, I need to figure out which emotion the speaker might be feeling based on their comment. The sentence given is, "It's not *literally* the same investigation." Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the structure of the sentence. The speaker uses an asterisk around "literally," which in writing usually emphasizes a word or adds nuance. Using emphasis here might indicate that they're correcting someone or pointing out a misunderstanding. So, the speaker is clarifying that something isn't exactly as it was previously thought.

Next, considering the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or neutral. I should match the tone of the sentence to one of these.

The statement doesn't express strong feelings like anger or disgust. There's no indication of fear or anxiety, nor does it show joy or happiness. Sadness isn't present either, and there's no element of surprise or astonishment here—it's more of a clarification rather than something unexpected.

So, the speaker is pointing out that two things aren't exactly the same in a literal sense. This correction could be seen as neutral because they're simply providing information without expressing any emotion. Alternatively, it might hint at some mild frustration if they feel the other person misunderstood, but given the lack of strong emotional language, it's safer to categorize this as neutral.

Therefore, I think the emotion here is **neutral**.

The speaker is clarifying a point without showing strong emotion, so the most appropriate category is:

**neutral**

Alright, so I need to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their Reddit comment: "It's not *literally* the same investigation." The options are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or neutral.

First, I'll look at the sentence itself. The speaker is responding to something someone else said about an investigation. They're clarifying that it's not exactly the same, using "not literally" which might be a way to correct or dismiss the other person's statement.

I should consider each emotion category:

1. **Anger**: This would involve strong displeasure or antagonism. The speaker doesn't seem angry; they're just correcting without any harsh words.

2. **Disgust**: Revulsion or disapproval. There's no indication of disgust here, just a clarification.

3. **Fear**: Fear involves being afraid or worried. The comment isn't about fear; it's more about setting the record straight.

4. **Joy**: Joy is happiness or pleasure. This doesn't seem to fit as there's no positive emotion expressed.

5. **Sadness**: Emotional pain or sorrow. Again, the speaker isn't expressing sadness here.

6. **Surprise**: Astonishment or realization. The comment isn't about something unexpected; it's a straightforward correction.

7. **Neutral**: Lacking emotion. This seems to fit because the speaker is simply clarifying without showing any strong emotion.

The use of "not *literally*" could imply that they're pointing out a slight inaccuracy, but it doesn't come off as annoyed or upset. It's more of a factual correction. So, I think the emotion here is neutral.
</think>

**neutral**

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The sentence given is: "It's not *literally* the same investigation." Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I'll look at the structure of the sentence. The speaker is using an asterisk before and after "literally," which usually indicates emphasis or a correction. They're pointing out that something isn't exactly the same as another, so they're clarifying. This suggests they might be trying to correct someone's misunderstanding.

Now, considering the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral. I need to pick one that best fits this statement.

Let me go through each option. Anger would involve strong displeasure or antagonism, but the speaker doesn't seem angry here—they're correcting rather than attacking. Disgust is about revulsion; there's no indication of that either. Fear isn't present since there's no sign of worry or anxiety. Joy involves pleasure, which also doesn't fit because they're not expressing happiness.

Sadness would involve sorrow or disappointment, but again, the speaker is just correcting a point, not showing sadness. Surprise includes astonishment, but unless the correction was unexpected to an extreme degree, it might not apply here. The most fitting emotion left is neutral because the speaker is simply clarifying without expressing any strong emotion.

I think "neutral" makes sense here because they're factually pointing out that it's not the same investigation, without showing any personal feeling or reaction.
</think>

**neutral**
