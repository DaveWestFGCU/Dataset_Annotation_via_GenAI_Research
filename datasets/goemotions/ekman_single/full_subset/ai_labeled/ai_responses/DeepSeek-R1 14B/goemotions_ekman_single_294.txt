Alright, let me try to figure out what emotion the speaker is conveying in this comment. The sentence is "/u/skyboundIan no spoilers in the trailer pretty please :D". 

First, I'll break down the components. The speaker is addressing someone by their username, which is common on Reddit for direct mentions. Then they're making a request: "no spoilers in the trailer pretty please". This sounds like a polite ask, maybe from someone who doesn't want to know too much about something before it's released, perhaps a movie or show.

The use of "please" and the smiley face :D are both indicators of politeness and friendliness. The speaker is being courteous and expressing a desire for no spoilers. There's no indication of strong emotions like anger or fear here; instead, it seems more about a hopeful or positive request.

Looking at the emotion categories provided: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral. I need to choose the most relevant one. The speaker isn't expressing any negative emotions but is making a polite request. This could lean towards joy because they're expressing a desire in a positive way, or maybe it's neutral if there's no strong emotion.

Wait, but the presence of "please" and a smiley might indicate happiness or excitement about the trailer, suggesting joy. However, the comment isn't overly enthusiastic; it's more of a simple request with a friendly tone. So maybe it's closer to neutral because it doesn't show strong positive or negative emotions—it's just a polite statement.

Alternatively, considering that they're expressing a desire without spoilers, which might be a wish for something pleasant, but the emotion isn't explicitly joy. It's more about a social request than an emotional expression. So I think the most accurate category here would be neutral because there's no strong emotion being conveyed—it's more of a factual statement with politeness.

Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their Reddit comment. The comment is "/u/skyboundIan no spoilers in the trailer pretty please :D". Let me break this down.

First, looking at the sentence structure and content. The speaker is addressing someone by their username, "/u/skyboundIan", which is common in Reddit comments to direct a message to another user. They're asking that there are "no spoilers in the trailer" and then adding "please :D". The use of "pretty please" makes it sound like a polite request, and the emoticon ":D" adds a smiley face, indicating happiness or friendliness.

The emotion categories given are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and neutral. I need to choose one based on the definitions provided.

Joy is described as including feelings of pleasure, happiness, and related emotions like amusement or excitement. The speaker's tone here seems positive; they're making a polite request in a friendly manner. The smiley face definitely supports this—smiling usually conveys joy or happiness.

Looking at other options: anger would involve strong displeasure, which doesn't fit here. Disgust is about revulsion, fear involves worry or anxiety, sadness is emotional pain, surprise is astonishment, and neutral is lacking emotion. None of these seem to fit as well as joy does.

The speaker's request is light-hearted and polite, without any signs of frustration or other negative emotions. So the most fitting emotion here is joy.

Alright, let me try to figure out what emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is: "/u/skyboundIan no spoilers in the trailer pretty please :D"

First, I'll break down the sentence. The speaker is addressing someone by their username, "/u/skyboundIan". They're making a request saying "no spoilers in the trailer" and then adding "pretty please :D". 

The phrase "pretty please" is a common polite expression used to make a request more appealing. It shows that the speaker is being courteous and maybe a bit playful or cheerful. The addition of ":D" which is a smiley face emoji, further indicates a positive tone.

Looking at the emotion categories provided: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral.

Anger doesn't seem to fit because there's no indication of frustration or displeasure here. Disgust isn't present either; the speaker isn't expressing revulsion or disapproval. Fear is about being afraid or worried, which isn't evident in this statement. Sadness would involve sorrow or disappointment, but again, that's not the case here.

Joy seems to align well because the speaker is making a polite and happy request, using friendly language and emojis which convey a sense of pleasure or happiness. Surprise doesn't apply as there's no unexpected information being presented. Neutral isn't the case either since the emotion expressed is clearly positive.

Therefore, considering all these points, the emotion here is joy.

**joy**
