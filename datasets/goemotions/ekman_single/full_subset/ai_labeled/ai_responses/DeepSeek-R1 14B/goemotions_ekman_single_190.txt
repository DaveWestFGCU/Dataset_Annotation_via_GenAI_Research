Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The sentence given is: "I find that relatable: I too am terrified of myself." Let me break this down.

First, looking at the structure of the sentence. They start by saying something is relatable, which often indicates agreement or understanding with someone else's feelings or experiences. Then they add their own feeling by saying, "I too am terrified of myself."

The key word here is "terrified," which clearly relates to fear. The emotion definitions mention that fear includes being afraid or worried, as well as nervousness and anxiety. So "terrified" falls under the fear category.

I should also consider if any other emotions might apply. For example, could this be sadness? Sadness involves emotional pain or sorrow, but the speaker is expressing a feeling of terror rather than sorrow. Disgust doesn't fit because there's no mention of something unpleasant. Anger isn't present either since there's no indication of displeasure or antagonism.

The sentence also doesn't show joy, surprise, or neutral feelings. It's a direct expression of fear about oneself, so the emotion is fear.

Alright, so I need to figure out the emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is: "I find that relatable: I too am terrified of myself." 

First, let's break down what this sentence means. The speaker is agreeing with something someone else said because they find it relatable. They're saying they also feel a similar wayâ€”"terrified of myself." 

Now, looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral.

The word "terrified" immediately stands out. That's a strong indicator of fear. Fear is defined as being afraid or worried, including nervousness and anxiety. So, when someone says they're terrified, that's clearly fear.

I should consider if any other emotions might fit here. Could it be sadness? Sadness includes emotional pain or sorrow, but "terrified" is more about fear than sadness. Disgust involves revulsion, which doesn't seem to apply here. Anger is a strong displeasure, but again, the primary emotion here is fear.

The speaker isn't expressing anger or surprise; they're sharing a personal feeling of fear. There's no indication of joy or neutral feelings either. So, putting it all together, the emotion here is fear.
