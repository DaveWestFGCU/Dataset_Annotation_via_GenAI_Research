Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is, "Thank you! That's the explanation I was looking for." Alright, let me break this down step by step.

First, the speaker is thanking someone, which immediately makes me think of positive emotions like joy or gratitude. Gratitude is actually part of the joy category according to the definitions provided. Joy includes feelings like appreciation and pleasure. So the use of "Thank you" suggests they're happy or satisfied with what was said or done.

Looking at the words, "That's the explanation I was looking for." shows that they were seeking information and now feel fulfilled because they've received it. This again points towards a positive emotion rather than something negative like anger or sadness.

I should also consider if any other emotions might fit. Could this be surprise? Well, surprise is more about being astonished by an unexpected event. The speaker isn't surprised; they were expecting the explanation and got it. So surprise doesn't quite apply here.

Disgust, fear, or neutral are definitely out of the question because there's no indication of aversion, worry, or lack of emotion. Anger is also not present since there's no sign of displeasure or antagonism in the comment.

So putting it all together, the speaker is expressing gratitude and satisfaction, which falls under the joy category.

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is, "Thank you! That's the explanation I was looking for." Alright, let me break this down.

First, I'll look at each emotion category and see which one fits best. The emotions are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and neutral.

Starting with anger: Anger usually involves expressions of displeasure or antagonism. Words like "hate," "don't like," or strong expletives might be present. Here, the speaker is thanking someone, so that doesn't seem to fit anger.

Next, disgust: This emotion is about revulsion or disapproval. If the speaker were disgusted, they might use words like "uggh" or express strong dislike. The comment seems positive, not negative, so disgust isn't likely here.

Fear would involve expressions of worry or nervousness. Words like "terrified," "scared," or concern might be present. Again, the speaker is expressing gratitude and satisfaction, so fear doesn't seem to apply.

Joy includes feelings of pleasure, happiness, gratitude. The speaker says "Thank you!" which is a direct expression of gratitude, a component of joy. They also mention that the explanation was what they were looking for, indicating relief or satisfaction, both part of joy.

Sadness involves pain or sorrow. There's no indication of sadness here; instead, the tone is positive and appreciative.

Surprise includes astonishment or unexpected events. The speaker isn't surprised but rather relieved or happy to have found the explanation they needed. So surprise doesn't fit either.

Neutral would be if there were no emotion expressed, but clearly, gratitude is present.

Putting it all together, the speaker is expressing joy through their thankful words and satisfaction with the received explanation.

I don't see any signs of anger or frustration here; instead, it's all positive. There's no indication of disgust, fear, or surprise. Sadness isn't present either because the tone is appreciative and happy. Neutral is when there's no emotion, but clearly, there's a positive feeling being conveyed.

So putting it all together, the emotion here is joy.
