Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment says, "Posts like these make it more and more clear how creepy [NAME] is." Let me break this down.

First, the words used are "creepy" which has a negative connotation. The speaker is describing someone as creepy, implying that they find this person unsettling or disturbing. Now, I need to match this emotion to one of the given categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or neutral.

Looking at the definitions:

- **Anger** involves displeasure or antagonism, like frustration or dislike.
- **Disgust** is revulsion or strong disapproval, often towards something unpleasant.
- **Fear** includes being afraid or worried, maybe feeling threatened.
- **Joy** and **sadness** are positive and negative emotions respectively but don't seem to fit here.
- **Surprise** is about astonishment, which isn't the case here since the speaker seems deliberate in their statement.
- **Neutral** would mean no emotion, which doesn't apply.

The comment expresses a strong dislike or disapproval of someone's behavior as revealed by their posts. Using "creepy" suggests that the speaker finds this person repulsive or offensive, which aligns more with disgust rather than anger because it's about finding something unpleasant rather than being annoyed or hostile.

So, I think the emotion here is **disgust**.

The speaker expresses strong disapproval and finds the person unsettling, fitting the definition of disgust.

**emotion**: **disgust**

Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment says, "Posts like these make it more and more clear how creepy [NAME] is." 

First, let's break down what this sentence is conveying. The speaker is talking about posts that are making them realize someone (referred to as [NAME]) is creepy. Using the word "creepy" suggests that the speaker has a negative view of [NAME]. Now, I have to match this emotion to one of the given categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or neutral.

Looking at the definitions:

- Anger involves displeasure or antagonism.
- Disgust is about revulsion or strong disapproval.
- Fear relates to being afraid or worried.
- Joy is positive feelings like happiness.
- Sadness involves emotional pain.
- Surprise is about astonishment or unexpected events.
- Neutral means no emotion.

The comment isn't expressing anger directly; it's more about judgment. Disgust fits because the speaker is disapproving of [NAME]'s behavior, using "creepy" as a strong term of disapproval. Fear would imply being scared, which isn't evident here. Joy and surprise are positive emotions that don't fit. Sadness is about pain, not necessarily judgment.

So, the emotion here is disgust because the speaker strongly disapproves of [NAME]'s actions.

Alright, let me try to figure out which emotion the speaker might be feeling based on their comment. The comment says, "Posts like these make it more and more clear how creepy [NAME] is." 

First, I'll break down what this sentence means. The speaker is talking about posts that are making them realize someone named [NAME] is creepy. Using words like "creepy" suggests a negative emotion. Now, I need to categorize this emotion into one of the given options: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or neutral.

Looking at the emotion definitions:

- Anger involves displeasure or antagonism.
- Disgust is revulsion or strong disapproval.
- Fear relates to being afraid or worried.
- Joy is positive feelings like happiness.
- Sadness involves emotional pain.
- Surprise is about astonishment.
- Neutral means no emotion.

The word "creepy" implies that the speaker has a strong negative feeling towards [NAME]. However, it's not necessarily anger because there's no obvious expression of dislike or hostility. It could be more about disapproval, which might lean towards disgust. Disgust is when someone feels strongly against something unpleasant, so calling someone creepy fits that.

I should also consider other possibilities. Is the speaker scared? Maybe, but "creepy" doesn't directly indicate fear; it's more about finding someone disturbing. Could it be surprise? Well, surprise usually involves something unexpected, and here the comment is a statement rather than an exclamation of shock.

So, putting it all together, the emotion that best fits this context is disgust because the speaker is expressing strong disapproval or revulsion towards [NAME].
