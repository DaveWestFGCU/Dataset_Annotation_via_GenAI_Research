Okay, I need to figure out what emotion the speaker might be feeling based on their comment. The comment is: "Took me a few times watching it to realize that was a man and not a child." 

First, let's break down the sentence. The speaker is mentioning that they had to watch something multiple times before realizing that someone was actually an adult male instead of a child. This suggests that the initial perception was incorrect.

Now, considering the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or neutral.

Looking at the examples provided:

- Anger usually involves expressions like dislike, frustration.
- Disgust is about revulsion or disapproval.
- Fear relates to being afraid or worried.
- Joy is happiness or pleasure.
- Sadness is emotional pain or sorrow.
- Surprise is astonishment or realization.
- Neutral means no emotion.

The comment seems to indicate a moment of realization. The speaker didn't realize the person's age at first, which could be surprising. Realization often falls under surprise because it's an unexpected understanding after initial confusion.

I don't see signs of anger, disgust, fear, joy, or sadness here. It's more about the sudden clarity that someone was older than initially thought. That points towards surprise.

Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is: "Took me a few times watching it to realize that was a man and not a child." Hmm.

First, let's break down what this sentence means. The speaker watched something multiple times and only just realized that the person in question was actually an adult, not a child. So their initial assumption was wrong, thinking it was a child, but upon rewatching, they corrected that mistake.

Now, looking at the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, or neutral. I need to determine which one fits best here.

The speaker didn't express any strong emotions like anger or joy directly. They're stating a fact about their realization after multiple viewings. There's no indication of happiness or excitement (joy), nor is there any obvious sign of fear or sadness.

What about surprise? Well, the process of realizing something they thought was one thing turned out to be another could be surprising. Maybe they were initially confused and then had a moment of clarity upon rewatching. That realization might have been unexpected, which fits into surprise.

Alternatively, is it neutral? The statement seems factual, but there's an element of correction involved, suggesting some reaction beyond neutrality. Realization often implies surprise.

So considering all this, the emotion here seems to be surprise because they had to figure out something they didn't realize before. It wasn't clear from one viewing, and upon rewatching, it clicked. That moment of realization could be surprising for them.

Alright, let me try to figure out what emotion the speaker is conveying here. The sentence is: "Took me a few times watching it to realize that was a man and not a child." 

First, I need to break down the content of the comment. It seems like the speaker watched something multiple times before realizing that someone was actually an adult male rather than a child. This realization might have happened later on, perhaps because the person's appearance or behavior initially seemed youthful.

Now, considering the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral.

I don't detect any signs of anger here. The speaker isn't expressing frustration or irritation. There's no indication of annoyance or disapproval either.

Disgust usually involves finding something unpleasant or offensive. The comment doesn't point to revulsion; it's more about a realization rather than disgust.

Fear is related to being afraid or worried. There's no mention of fear, nervousness, or anxiety in the statement.

Joy includes happiness and positive emotions. The speaker isn't expressing any joy or pleasure here; it seems more like an observation rather than a happy feeling.

Sadness involves emotional pain or sorrow. Again, there's nothing to suggest disappointment, grief, or remorse.

Surprise is about being astonished or startled by something unexpected. The realization that someone was a man and not a child could be seen as surprising because it took multiple viewings to notice. It might imply that the speaker didn't expect this person to appear adult initially, which could lead to surprise.

Neutral would mean no emotion is expressed, but since the speaker made an observation, there's at least some cognitive response, possibly with an element of surprise involved.

Putting it all together, the key emotion here seems to be surprise. The speaker was surprised by their realization after watching multiple times.
