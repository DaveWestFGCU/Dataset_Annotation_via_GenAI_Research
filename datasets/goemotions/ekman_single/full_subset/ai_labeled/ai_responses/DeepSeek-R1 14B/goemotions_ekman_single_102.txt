Alright, let me try to figure out which emotion the speaker is conveying here. The sentence given is "don't we all hate them?" So first, I'll break down what this means.

The speaker is using the word "hate," which immediately makes me think of anger or strong dislike. They're asking if others share their sentiment, suggesting a collective feeling against someone or something. This seems more than just mild irritation; it's a strong negative emotion directed towards a group.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger is defined as a strong feeling of displeasure or antagonism. The examples given for anger include expressions of intense dislike and frustration, which align with "hate." Disgust involves revulsion but usually refers to something unpleasant rather than targeting people directly. Fear relates more to being afraid or worried, which doesn't quite fit here. Joy and surprise are obviously not applicable since the tone is negative. Sadness could be a possibility if it's about emotional pain, but "hate" leans more towards anger.

So, putting it all together, the speaker is expressing strong dislike or antagonism, fitting the definition of anger.

Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is "don't we all hate them?" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the words used. The word "hate" stands out because it's a strong negative emotion. When someone says "hate," they're typically expressing dislike or intense annoyance towards something or someone.

Next, the structure of the sentence is a rhetorical question: "don't we all hate them?" This suggests that the speaker is expecting others to agree with their sentiment. Rhetorical questions like this often indicate that the speaker is sharing a common feeling or seeking confirmation from others.

Looking at the emotion categories provided, I need to choose between anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and neutral. Let's consider each:

- **Anger**: Anger includes strong feelings of displeasure or antagonism. The use of "hate" fits here because it shows intense dislike.
- **Disgust**: This is more about revulsion towards something unpleasant. While "hate" could be involved, the question seems to focus on a shared feeling rather than describing an object as offensive.
- **Fear**: Doesn't seem applicable here since there's no indication of worry or nervousness.
- **Joy/Sadness/Surprise/Neutral**: These don't fit because the statement is clearly negative.

So, the emotion that best fits is anger. The speaker is expressing dislike and possibly frustration, which aligns with the definition of anger provided.

The speaker uses strong language ("hate") in a rhetorical question, indicating intense dislike or annoyance. This aligns most closely with the emotion of anger.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which emotion the speaker is feeling based on their comment. The comment is: "don't we all hate them?" 

First, let me break down the sentence. They're asking if others also feel the same way about something or someone. The word "hate" here is key because it's a strong negative emotion. "Hate" falls under anger according to the definitions provided, as anger includes feelings like dislike and antagonism.

Looking at the other options: disgust usually involves revulsion towards something unpleasant, fear is about being afraid, joy is positive, sadness is sorrow, surprise is astonishment, and neutral means no emotion. None of these fit as well as anger because "hate" directly relates to displeasure or strong dislike.

So, putting it all together, the speaker is expressing a feeling of anger by using the word "hate." There's no indication of other emotions like fear or surprise in this statement.
