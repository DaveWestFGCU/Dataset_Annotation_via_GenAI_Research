Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions feeling a sense of hatred towards the person in question.
* However, they express strong disapproval against the violent actions taken by someone else against this person (running them off the road and holding them at gunpoint).
* The speaker explicitly states "No way" to justify such actions, indicating a strong moral objection.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**anger**

The speaker's tone suggests anger towards the perpetrator of violence, rather than fear, sadness, or surprise. There is no indication of disgust, and the speaker's response is not neutral. The phrase "I get" implies a sense of understanding or empathy with others who might feel hatred towards the person in question, but it does not negate the speaker's strong disapproval of violent actions.
