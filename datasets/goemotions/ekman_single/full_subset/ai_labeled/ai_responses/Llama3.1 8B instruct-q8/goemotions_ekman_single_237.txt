Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses the phrase "It's a shame" which typically implies disappointment or regret.
* The comment is made in a lighthearted and humorous tone, with the addition of "lol", which suggests that the speaker is not genuinely upset.

Given these points, I would conclude that the speaker is expressing **sadness**. While the tone is playful, the sentiment behind it is still one of disappointment or wistfulness about something being missing (in this case, sound).

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker expresses a sentiment about something lacking, specifically sound.
* The tone seems lighthearted and playful with the use of "lol".
* There's no indication of strong emotion or negativity.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is **surprise**, as the speaker appears to be expressing mild surprise or disappointment that there is no sound. However, it's worth noting that this surprise is not intense enough to be classified as a stronger emotion like fear or anger, and the tone is more playful than serious.
