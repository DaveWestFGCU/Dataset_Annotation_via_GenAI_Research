Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is making a comment that appears to be mocking or criticizing another player's behavior.
* The language used is informal and derogatory, with the use of the phrase "tbag" which is a slang term for killing players in a game, implying that the survivor is being unfairly targeted.

Most relevant emotion label: **anger**

The speaker's tone and language suggest that they are expressing anger or frustration towards another player who is "playing pig" (likely a reference to playing as a healer or support character) in order to kill survivors. The use of derogatory language implies a sense of disapproval and annoyance, which are key components of the emotion of anger.
