Response 1:
Important points to consider:

**sadness**

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The word "sadly" is used at the beginning of the sentence, which often indicates a negative tone.
* The speaker is responding with a brief statement that seems to be a reaction to something.
* There is no mention of strong emotions like anger or fear.

Given these considerations, I would say that the emotion most people will feel the speaker may be feeling is:

**sadness**

The use of "sadly" suggests that the speaker is expressing disappointment or sadness about something.

Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses the word "sadly", which implies a negative emotional tone.
* The speaker's response is brief and lacks any language that would indicate a positive emotion.
* There is no indication of surprise or anger in the speaker's response.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is **sadness**.
