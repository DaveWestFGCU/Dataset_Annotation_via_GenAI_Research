Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker seems to be responding to a situation where someone has tried something but it didn't work out.
* The tone is matter-of-fact and lacks emotional language, such as exclamation marks or emotive words.
* The sentence structure is straightforward and doesn't convey any strong emotions.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label for this speaker's comment is:

**neutral**

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker seems to be expressing a reservation or condition related to the effectiveness of something ("doesn't really work").
* The phrase "if the DM doesn't want it to" suggests that there is an external factor (the DM's desire) that could impact the outcome.
* The tone appears to be somewhat matter-of-fact and neutral, rather than expressing strong emotion.

Based on these points, I would conclude that:

**neutral**

The speaker seems to be stating a fact or condition, without expressing any particular emotion. They are not criticizing, disagreeing, or reacting with surprise, fear, anger, disgust, or joy; they are simply providing context for why something may not work as intended.
