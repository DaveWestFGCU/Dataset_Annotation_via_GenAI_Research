Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker asks "Do you Agree" (DAO), which suggests they are seeking agreement or validation from others.
* They describe the person they dislike as "unnecessarily salty", implying that this person is overly negative or harsh in their comments.
* The tone of the comment is lighthearted and casual, with a hint of playful sarcasm.

Most relevant emotion label: **anger**. 
While the speaker's tone may be light-hearted, the underlying sentiment appears to be annoyance or frustration towards people who are overly negative or harsh in their comments.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker asks if anyone else hates certain type of people.
* The term "salty" implies someone who is being overly negative or bitter.
* The speaker's tone appears to be inquiring rather than accusatory.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label for this comment is **anger**. The speaker is expressing frustration with a particular behavior (being "salty") and inviting others to share their similar feelings of annoyance.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker asks "Do Any of You" (DAE), which suggests they're seeking agreement from others.
* They describe the person(s) they dislike as "unnecessarily salty", implying a negative behavior.
* The tone is informal and conversational, with a hint of rhetorical question.

Given these points, I would say that the speaker is expressing **anger**, but not necessarily directed at the original poster (OP), rather at people who exhibit annoying behavior.
