Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker's tone appears to be mocking or teasing.
* The comment is directed at someone they claim to know in real life (u/irl), implying a personal relationship or familiarity with the person.
* The comment contains a comparison, stating that the person looks older than their age.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label for this speaker's tone is:

**surprise**

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker's tone appears to be mocking or teasing.
* The language used is informal and slightly derogatory ("u" instead of "you", "irl" for "in real life").
* The comment seems to be making a comment about the other person's appearance.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label would be:

**disgust**
 
This classification is based on the speaker's apparent distaste or revulsion towards the person they are commenting on. Although anger could also be a possible interpretation, the tone of the comment seems more dismissive and mocking than angry.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the comment is informal and slightly mocking.
* The speaker is addressing someone they claim to know in real life ("u irl").
* They make a comment about the person's appearance, specifically their age.

Given these points, it appears that the speaker is making a lighthearted but also somewhat critical or teasing remark. 

**surprise**

However, given the tone and content of the comment, it seems more likely that the speaker is being playful rather than genuinely surprised. But among the options provided, **surprise** might be the closest match due to the unexpected nature of the comment.

A closer examination suggests an alternative emotion label: **anger**'s related categories (disapproval or annoyance) are at play here, as the speaker seems to be making a slightly mocking remark about the person's appearance. 

An alternative choice is: **disgust**, but that would imply stronger revulsion than what the comment conveys.

Another possible interpretation is that the speaker's tone could be seen as somewhat **anger**ous due to the teasing or mocking nature of the comment, despite its lighthearted tone.

However, considering the context and tone, a more fitting label might actually be: **anger**

Response 4:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the comment seems mocking and condescending.
* The language used implies that the speaker has made an assumption about the person's appearance, specifically their age.
* The tone does not express empathy or concern for the other person.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **disgust**, as the speaker's tone appears to be one of revulsion or strong disapproval towards the person they are referring to.
