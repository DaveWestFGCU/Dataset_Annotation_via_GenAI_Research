Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is providing feedback on the advice given in the post.
* They are warning against using certain methods, specifically dreams' own encryption and igolder.
* The tone appears to be cautionary, with a sense of disapproval.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is **disgust**, as the speaker is expressing strong disapproval or revulsion towards the advice given.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker explicitly states that the given advice is "pretty bad".

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker's tone appears cautionary and warning.
* They are advising against using certain methods, specifically referencing "dreams own encryption" and "things such as igolder".
* There is no apparent personal attack or insult.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is **sadness**. However, sadness may not be the primary emotion here. The speaker's tone suggests a more neutral warning tone, but with a hint of concern or frustration at the advice being given.

However, upon closer inspection, I would argue that the speaker's emotions lean towards **disgust**, as they are strongly disapproving of the advice being offered and are warning against it in a clear and direct manner.
