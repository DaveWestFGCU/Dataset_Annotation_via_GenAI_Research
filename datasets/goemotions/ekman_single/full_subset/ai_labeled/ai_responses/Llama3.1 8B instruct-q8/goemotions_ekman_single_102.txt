Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses a rhetorical question ("don't we all hate them?") that implies a shared sentiment among others.
* The tone of the statement is negative and critical, using the word "hate".
* There is no indication of surprise or excitement.

Based on these considerations, the most relevant emotion label for this text is **anger**.

Response 2:
Here are the important points to consider and the most relevant emotion label:

* The speaker uses the word "hate" which implies strong negative emotions towards something.
* The tone is brief and lacks explanation, implying a sense of shared understanding or assumption with others.
* There is no clear object of dislike being explicitly stated, but it's implied that the audience shares this sentiment.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label for the speaker in this sentence is:

**anger**

The reason I chose anger is that while "hate" can be a strong form of disgust or fear, in this context, it seems to imply a more intense and personal negative feeling than simple revulsion or worry. The tone also suggests a sense of shared frustration or annoyance rather than just disapproval or concern.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses the word "hate" which can indicate a strong negative emotion.
* The context of the statement suggests it is a response to something that is perceived as universally disliked, possibly a person or entity mentioned in the original post.
* There is no indication of surprise, fear, joy, sadness, or neutrality in the tone or language used.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label for this text is:

**anger**
 
Note: The use of "hate" may also suggest disgust, but anger seems to be a more fitting choice as it implies a strong negative emotional response rather than simply revulsion.
