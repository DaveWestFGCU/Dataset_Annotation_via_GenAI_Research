Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions being "thankful" which suggests a positive sentiment.
* However, they also mention that not knowing the outcome would have "haunted" them, implying a negative emotional consequence of their uncertainty.
* The tone is introspective and personal.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is **sadness**. The speaker's use of the word "haunt" suggests a sense of emotional pain or sorrow associated with not knowing the outcome, which fits with the definition of sadness as including disappointment and emotional pain.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions being "thankful" for the conclusion, which suggests a positive outcome.
* They also mention that not knowing the outcome would have "haunted" them, implying a sense of relief or anxiety alleviation.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **relief**, but since relief isn't an option, the closest match is **joy** (specifically, gratitude), as it encompasses feelings of appreciation and positivity.

However, considering the context, I'd argue that **sadness** is a less likely choice because the speaker expresses gratitude rather than regret or sorrow. 

Since the best fit from the given options isn't perfect, but still suitable, I'll choose:

**joy**

But keep in mind that relief would be an even more fitting emotion label if it were an option!

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker expresses gratitude ("So thankful") which suggests a positive emotion.
* The phrase "Having no idea how this played out" implies a sense of uncertainty or unease, but is resolved by the conclusion.
* The word "haunt" typically has a negative connotation, implying a lingering fear or anxiety.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**relief** (not listed as an option, but closest to joy which involves relief)

However, since relief isn't an available option and we need to choose from the provided categories, I will select the one that is most closely related to joy, considering that relief is often a component of joy.

**joy**

Note: If you'd like me to explain why I didn't choose a different emotion, please let me know!
