Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is responding to a statement or question that is not present in the given text.
* The tone of the response seems sarcastic and dismissive, implying annoyance or frustration.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**anger**

The reason for this choice is that the speaker's response appears to be a defensive or annoyed reaction to an implied criticism or statement about individuals living with their parents. The use of "millions" in the response may also convey a sense of annoyance at being confronted with an idea or statistic that the speaker finds off-putting or frustrating.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker seems to be responding to someone else's comment or statement.
* The tone is somewhat confrontational, as indicated by the use of a rhetorical question ("You mean...").
* The speaker appears to be highlighting a contrast between two groups (college graduates living with their parents vs. others), which may imply some level of disapproval or criticism.

Most relevant emotion label: **anger**

The speaker's tone and language suggest that they are expressing annoyance or frustration at the idea of college graduates living with their parents, which is implied to be a common phenomenon. The use of a rhetorical question and the highlighting of this contrast may indicate that the speaker is feeling angry or displeased about this situation.
