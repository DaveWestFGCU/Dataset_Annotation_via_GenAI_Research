Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the sentence is short and abrupt.
* The use of all capital letters emphasizes the speaker's point, but may also convey frustration or annoyance.
* The sentence lacks any explanatory context or justification, which might suggest a dismissive attitude.

Given these considerations, the emotion most people will feel the speaker may be feeling is:

**anger**

The speaker's tone and language suggest a sense of irritation or exasperation, which aligns with the definition of anger.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses all capital letters, which can convey emphasis or frustration.
* The phrase "OH YEAH ITS FINE" is a very brief and simple statement.
* There are no obvious negative emotions expressed in the comment.

Given these considerations, I would guess that the speaker is trying to convey a sense of resignation or frustration, but not necessarily one of the stronger negative emotions like anger or disgust. 

**sadness**

Note: The tone of the comment could also be interpreted as neutral, if the phrase "OH YEAH ITS FINE" is simply a straightforward acknowledgement rather than an expression of emotion. However, the use of all capital letters and the simplicity of the statement suggest that there may be some underlying emotional tone at play.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the comment is abrupt and short.
* The use of all capital letters emphasizes the sentiment.
* The phrase "ITS FINE" could be interpreted as dismissive or uninterested.

Given these considerations, the emotion that best fits the speaker's sentiment is likely **anger**. This interpretation is based on the assumption that the speaker is responding to a situation where they feel frustrated or annoyed, and their comment is a way of expressing that anger in a brief and assertive manner.
