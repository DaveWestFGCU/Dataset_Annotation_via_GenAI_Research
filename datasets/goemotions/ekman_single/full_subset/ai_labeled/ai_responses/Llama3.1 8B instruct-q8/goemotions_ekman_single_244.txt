Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses the word "tragedies" which has a negative connotation.
* The tone of the statement is somewhat ironic and sarcastic, implying that the person is not actually referring to an actual tragedy, but rather something more mundane or humorous.

Given these considerations, I would categorize this emotion as:

**sadness**

The reason for choosing sadness is that the speaker's use of the word "tragedies" implies a sense of disappointment and possibly even mocking, which are both emotions related to sadness. The tone of the statement suggests that the person is being facetious or ironic, implying that they don't actually think they are tragedies, but rather are commenting on how their situation might be perceived by others as tragic or pathetic.
