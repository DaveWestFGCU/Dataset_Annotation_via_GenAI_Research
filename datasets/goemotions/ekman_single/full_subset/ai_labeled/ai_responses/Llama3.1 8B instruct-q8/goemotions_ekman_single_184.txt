Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is responding to a specific aspect of a movie, criticizing a plot choice.
* The tone is focused on critique rather than praise or personal experience.
* The language used ("bad idea", "need to be making moves") implies a sense of disapproval.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**anger**

The speaker's criticism and use of negative language suggest that they are feeling displeasure or antagonism towards the plot choice in question.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is critiquing an aspect of a movie (icing villains), suggesting it would make the story less engaging.
* The tone appears to be analytical and concerned with storytelling, rather than emotional or personal.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**anger**

Reason: Although the speaker's tone is critical, there doesn't seem to be any explicit anger towards a person or group. However, if we interpret "bad idea" as implying frustration or annoyance at the thought of a poorly constructed story, then it could be considered a mild form of anger. Nevertheless, this interpretation stretches the definition slightly, and a more neutral tone would fit better with the analysis.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker appears to be offering constructive criticism on a story or plot.
* They use the phrase "bad idea," which implies disapproval.
* However, they also provide specific suggestions for improvement ("They need to be making moves").

Given these points, it seems that the speaker is expressing a negative opinion in order to improve something. This suggests that their tone is critical, but ultimately aimed at helping.

**anger**

The speaker's criticism does not seem to be fueled by anger or aggression, but rather a desire to see improvement. The language used is straightforward and matter-of-fact, without any personal attacks or emotional outbursts characteristic of anger.
