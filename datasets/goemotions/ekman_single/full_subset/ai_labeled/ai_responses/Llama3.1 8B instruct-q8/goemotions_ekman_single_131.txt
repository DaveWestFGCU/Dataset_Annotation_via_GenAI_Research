Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is making a humorous remark about someone else.
* The comment implies that the person being referred to has a physical condition related to sweating.
* The tone of the comment is lighthearted and playful.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label for this comment is **disgust**. However, I would argue that it's more accurate to say that the speaker is making a humorous remark about something unpleasant or repulsive (i.e., Cheetos dust coming out of someone's sweat), rather than expressing disgust themselves. But if we're looking at the emotion conveyed in the comment, it's closest to **disgust**, albeit with a tongue-in-cheek tone.

However, given the context and tone of the comment, I would argue that the most fitting answer is actually **surprise**. The speaker says they "wouldn't be surprised" if the Cheetos dust was coming out of his sweat, implying that it's an unexpected or amusing consequence, which aligns more with surprise than disgust.

But since we're following the instructions to choose one emotion from the given list, I would say the most relevant emotion label is **surprise**.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker makes a humorous comment about someone else.
* The comment implies that the person is dirty and unhygienic.
* The tone is lighthearted and playful, rather than aggressive or serious.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **disgust**. While the comment is not overtly disgusted, it does express a sense of revulsion or strong disapproval towards the person's cleanliness (or lack thereof). However, the tone is more playful than genuinely disgusted, which is why I wouldn't categorize it as full-blown disgust.
