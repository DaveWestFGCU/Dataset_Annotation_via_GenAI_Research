Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions that people can argue as much as they want, implying a sense of resignation or helplessness.
* The phrase "life simply doesn't work that way" suggests a matter-of-fact tone, implying that the speaker has accepted a reality that may be frustrating or difficult for others.
* The inclusion of "lol" at the end indicates that the speaker is attempting to inject some humor into their response.

Most relevant emotion label: **neutral**
The speaker's tone appears to be matter-of-fact and resigned, without any clear expression of strong emotions. They seem to be stating a fact or reality, rather than expressing an emotional response. The inclusion of "lol" adds a hint of playfulness, but overall the tone is neutral and detached.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker seems to be dismissing an argument made by others.
* The tone of the comment is lighthearted and humorous, with the use of the phrase "lol" at the end.
* The speaker's response is more of a statement of fact rather than a emotional reaction.

Given these points, I would categorize the emotion as:

**joy**

The speaker's use of humor and the dismissive yet lighthearted tone suggests that they are taking a neutral or even positive stance on the situation. The comment does not convey any negative emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is responding to an argument or disagreement with others.
* The tone of the comment seems casual and nonchalant.
* The phrase "lol" suggests a lighthearted or humorous attitude.

Given these considerations, I would say that the emotion most people will feel the speaker may be feeling is **joy**. The speaker's use of humor ("lol") and dismissive tone suggest they are not taking the argument seriously, which aligns with the definition of joy (specifically, amusement).
