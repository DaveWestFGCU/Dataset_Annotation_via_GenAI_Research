Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions they're "glad" about being almost 50, which implies a positive tone.
* They express that the things being discussed are beyond their comprehension or understanding, using phrases like "will never ever experience" and "can hardly fathom".
* The overall context suggests that the speaker is commenting on events or experiences related to younger people, possibly in a nostalgic or amused way.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label for this comment is **joy**.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions their age, being almost 50, which could indicate a sense of distance or detachment from the topic.
* They express relief that they won't have to experience what's being discussed.
* The tone is somewhat dismissive and perplexed, as indicated by "and frankly can hardly fathom".

Given these points, it appears that the speaker is expressing relief and disconnection from the situation, but not necessarily with a strong negative emotion. They seem to be more bemused than upset.

**sadness**

This label might initially seem counterintuitive, given that sadness is often associated with pain or loss. However, in this context, the speaker's tone suggests a sense of resignation and disconnection from the world around them. This can sometimes be a characteristic of older adults who feel they've seen it all before, and it's not uncommon for people nearing retirement age to feel a mix of emotions about their place in society.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions being grateful for their age ("almost 50") and implies that it's a positive aspect of their life.
* They express relief or satisfaction at not having to deal with the things they're talking about.
* The tone is somewhat nostalgic, but also dismissive and uninterested in the experiences they're discussing.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**sadness**
 
The speaker's comment suggests a sense of detachment and melancholy, particularly when they say "I will never ever experience" and "cannot hardly fathom". These phrases imply a sense of sadness or regret about missing out on certain experiences, even if it's framed as a positive thing.
