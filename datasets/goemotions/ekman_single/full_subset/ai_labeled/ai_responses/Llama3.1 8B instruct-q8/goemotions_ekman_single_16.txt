Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is addressing someone with a term of endearment ("old man"), which may suggest a tone that is familiar and playful.
* The phrase "The future is now" is often used as a celebratory or optimistic statement, indicating that the speaker believes progress has been made or change is happening.
* However, the speaker's use of this phrase in response to another comment suggests they are responding to something specific that has led them to make this statement.

Given these points, it appears the speaker is expressing a sense of **joy**, as the tone and language used suggest excitement and optimism.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the speaker seems playful and slightly teasing.
* The phrase "old man" could be used as an affectionate term, but it also has a connotation of being outdated or out of touch.
* The speaker's comment appears to be a response to another commenter or post, suggesting that there may be a context or previous conversation that is not provided.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label for this text is:

**surprise**

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses an informal and somewhat dismissive tone by addressing the other person as "old man".
* The phrase "The future is now" could be interpreted as a statement of fact, but in this context, it seems to be used in a provocative or ironic way.
* There's no clear indication of a specific issue or problem being discussed.

Given these points, I would consider the following:

* Anger: Unlikely, as there's no apparent source of frustration or irritation.
* Disgust: Possible, but not strongly indicated. The tone is more playful than repulsed.
* Fear: No clear indication of fear or anxiety.
* Joy: Not strongly indicated, although the use of a somewhat dismissive tone could be interpreted as a hint of amusement.
* Sadness: Unlikely, as there's no apparent expression of pain or sorrow.
* Surprise: Possible, but not strongly indicated. The phrase "The future is now" might be used to express surprise, but in this context, it seems more likely to be a statement meant to provoke a reaction.

Most relevant emotion label: **surprise**
