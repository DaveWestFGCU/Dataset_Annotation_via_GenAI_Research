Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is responding to someone who may have made a similar comment or comparison.
* The phrase "*literally*" suggests that the previous statement was taken too far or misinterpreted by the speaker.
* The tone of the response seems to be correcting or clarifying the previous statement, rather than expressing a strong emotion.

Most relevant emotion label: **neutral**
The speaker's response appears to be neutral and matter-of-fact, aiming to clarify the distinction between their original comment and the comparison made by someone else.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses an asterisk to emphasize their point, indicating that they are making a distinction.
* They use the word "literally", which is often used to convey that someone has misinterpreted or taken something too far.

Given these points, it appears that the speaker is reacting to someone else's misunderstanding or misinterpretation of their words. The tone is more matter-of-fact than aggressive or emotive.

**surprise**
 
The speaker seems to be surprised by someone's incorrect interpretation of their statement and is clarifying it.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is responding to something that might be perceived as an inaccurate comparison.
* The phrase "*literally*" is being used by the speaker to emphasize that there are differences between two investigations, implying that someone else may have made a misleading or false equivalence.
* There's no apparent emotional language like "I'm so angry" or "I feel sad", but rather a corrective statement.

Based on these points, it seems the speaker is responding to an inaccurate claim in a matter-of-fact way, without expressing strong emotions. However, considering that they are correcting someone else, there might be a hint of *neutral* (as they're not showing explicit emotion), but also **surprise** because the speaker might be surprised by the original commenter's mistake or the need to clarify the difference.

Given the context and tone, I'd lean towards **neutral**, as the speaker appears to be simply clarifying a point without expressing strong emotions.
