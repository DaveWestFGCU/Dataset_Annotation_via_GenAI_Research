Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses the phrase "Funny how" which can be an expression of irony or sarcasm.
* The tone of the sentence seems somewhat casual and dismissive, with no strong emotional language used.
* The commenter is responding to a previous post or comment, suggesting they are reacting to something that has been said.

Given these points, I would say the speaker's emotion is likely **neutral**, as there is no clear indication of strong feeling or emotional tone in their response.
