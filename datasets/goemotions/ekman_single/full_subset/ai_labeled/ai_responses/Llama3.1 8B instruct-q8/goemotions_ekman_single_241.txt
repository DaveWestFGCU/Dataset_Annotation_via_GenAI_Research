Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the sentence is somewhat begrudging and resigned.
* The speaker seems to be acknowledging that something might make sense, but also expressing a lack of expectation for positive outcomes or gratitude from others.
* There's no overtly negative language or strong emotions expressed.

Most relevant emotion label: **sadness**

The speaker's sentiment can be interpreted as disappointed or pessimistic about the expectations they have for how others will behave. They seem to be acknowledging that something might make sense, but also expressing a sense of resignation and lack of optimism about the positive outcomes or gratitude from others. This is closest to the definition of sadness, which includes disappointment and emotional pain.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the statement appears somewhat passive-aggressive.
* The speaker seems to be hinting that others are not grateful for something.
* The phrase "don't expect much thanks" implies a sense of resentment or frustration.

Given these considerations, the emotion most likely being expressed by the speaker is **sadness**, as it suggests a feeling of emotional pain and sorrow due to unappreciated efforts.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker seems to be acknowledging that something makes sense.
* However, they also express skepticism about receiving gratitude or appreciation from others ("don't expect much thanks").
* The tone is somewhat dry and matter-of-fact.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is **neutral**. The speaker's statement appears to lack an expressed emotion, such as anger, sadness, or joy, and instead presents a neutral observation about human behavior.
