Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses a phrase commonly associated with expressing disapproval or dislike ("looks like modern art"), which might suggest a negative tone.
* However, the speaker immediately follows this statement with a positive phrase ("but its good"), indicating that they actually appreciate the subject.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**neutral**
 
Although the speaker's comment starts off in a somewhat critical manner (like modern art), it quickly resolves into a neutral or even slightly positive assessment ("but its good"). The tone remains matter-of-fact and doesn't express strong emotions like anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses the phrase "looks like modern art," which often implies that something is confusing, pretentious, or unimpressive.
* However, they immediately follow this statement with "tbh" (to be honest), suggesting a slightly more genuine tone.
* They then conclude their comment by saying "its good," indicating a somewhat positive assessment of the subject.

Given these points, the speaker's tone appears to be playful and tongue-in-cheek, rather than genuinely angry or disgusted. While they might be poking fun at modern art, there is no indication that they are truly upset or offended.

Most relevant emotion label: **joy**

The speaker's use of "tbh" and their conclusion with "its good" suggests a lighthearted and approving tone, which aligns with the joy category.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is referring to something as "modern art", which is often perceived as pretentious or overhyped.
* The use of "tbh" (to be honest) suggests a tone that could be ironic, sarcastic, or ambivalent.
* The phrase "its good" seems to soften the initial criticism, indicating that despite initial reservations, the speaker actually finds value in what they're looking at.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**surprise**
 
The speaker's tone and language suggest a mix of skepticism (due to the modern art reference) and appreciation (with "its good"). This contrast implies a sense of surprise or even delight at discovering something that exceeded their initial expectations.

Response 4:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses the phrase "modern art," which often carries a negative connotation.
* However, they immediately follow it with "tbh" (to be honest), which suggests that their intention is not to be completely dismissive or negative.
* They then express a positive sentiment by stating that the thing in question ("it") is "good."

Given these points, it seems that the speaker is expressing a neutral-to-positive tone. However, they are also using a phrase that is often associated with irony or sarcasm.

**neutral**

Note: While the speaker's tone may be playful or ironic, the overall sentiment expressed is more akin to a matter-of-fact observation rather than a strong emotion.
