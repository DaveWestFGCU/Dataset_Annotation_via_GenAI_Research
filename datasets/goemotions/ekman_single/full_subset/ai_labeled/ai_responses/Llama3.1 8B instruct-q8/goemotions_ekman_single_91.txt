Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is making a comment on someone else's living situation.
* They are implying that the person's financial situation has changed since they moved out of their previous living arrangement (likely with family or roommates).
* The tone of the comment is critical and judgmental, suggesting that the speaker believes the person should be able to afford basic household appliances.

Given these points, it appears that the speaker is expressing a negative emotion towards the person's financial situation. The most relevant emotion label for this comment is:

**anger**

Note: While disgust could also be a possibility, given the speaker's critical tone, anger seems more likely as they are directly criticizing the person's financial decision-making rather than simply expressing distaste or revulsion.
