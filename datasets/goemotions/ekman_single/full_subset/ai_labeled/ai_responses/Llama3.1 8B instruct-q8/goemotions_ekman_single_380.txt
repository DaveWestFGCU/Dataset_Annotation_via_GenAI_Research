Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is expressing uncertainty about whether they want someone back, which suggests a complex emotional state.
* The tone is somewhat conditional, implying that the speaker has certain expectations or requirements for the person's return.
* The phrase "at this level" implies a sense of high standards or performance.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**sadness**

Additionally, the conditional nature of their agreement and the emphasis on high standards may imply that the speaker has been disappointed or hurt in the past, further supporting the sadness emotion label.
