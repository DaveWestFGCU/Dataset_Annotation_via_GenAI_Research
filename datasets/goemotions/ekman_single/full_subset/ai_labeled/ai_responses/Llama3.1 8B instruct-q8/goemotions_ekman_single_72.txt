Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses the phrase "Here's hoping," which typically implies a desire for something to end or change.
* The tone of the comment is somewhat casual and lighthearted, with the use of "lol" at the end.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label for this comment is:

**sadness**

The speaker seems to be expressing a sentiment of disappointment or frustration that they wish something would end soon, which falls under the category of sadness.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses "lol", which can be an abbreviation for "laugh out loud" but also sometimes used as a way to express sarcasm or irony.
* The phrase "ends soon" suggests that the speaker is expressing a desire for something to stop or conclude.
* The tone of the comment seems to be lighthearted and casual, but there's no clear indication of happiness or excitement.

Given these points, I would say that the most relevant emotion label for this comment is:

**sadness**

The speaker's use of "lol" could be interpreted as a way to mask their true emotions, and the phrase "ends soon" suggests that they're hoping something unpleasant will come to an end. The tone is lighthearted, but it's not necessarily joyful or celebratory.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses a colloquial expression ("Here's hoping") that implies they're making a light-hearted comment.
* The phrase "lol" at the end suggests the speaker is trying to be humorous or ironic.
* The context of the comment is likely a situation where the speaker is frustrated, annoyed, or tired of waiting for something to end.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**sadness**

The reason is that while the speaker's tone appears light-hearted, the underlying sentiment seems to be one of relief and longing for an end to a frustrating or unpleasant situation. This aligns with the sadness category definition, which includes emotional pain and sorrow (even if it's not extreme).
