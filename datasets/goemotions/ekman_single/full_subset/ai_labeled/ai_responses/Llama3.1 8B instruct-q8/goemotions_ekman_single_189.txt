Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The sentence is a question, which suggests that the speaker is seeking information or clarification.
* The context of the conversation is unclear, but the tone appears to be casual and somewhat playful.
* The speaker's use of "her turn" implies that there may be an expectation or routine being referenced.

Given these points, it's likely that the speaker is feeling **surprise**. This emotion label fits because the speaker seems to be asking a question as if they are expecting something specific, but aren't entirely sure what the answer will be. The tone of the sentence also has a somewhat curious and playful quality to it, which aligns with the definition of surprise.

Important points to consider:

* The tone of the statement appears to be questioning or probing rather than expressing a strong emotion.
* The language used is straightforward and lacks emotional intensity.
