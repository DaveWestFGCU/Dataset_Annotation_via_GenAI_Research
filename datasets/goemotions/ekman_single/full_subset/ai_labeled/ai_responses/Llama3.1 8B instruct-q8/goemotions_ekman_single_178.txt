Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker's comment is a quote from an unknown source.
* It appears to be a philosophical or poetic statement.
* There are no overtly negative or positive emotions expressed in the comment.

Given these considerations, the emotion most people will feel the speaker may be feeling is **neutral**. The comment seems to be more of a thought-provoking statement than an expression of emotion.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker's tone appears to be ironic and tongue-in-cheek, as indicated by the use of parentheses at the end.
* The language used is somewhat abstract and poetic, which may suggest a sense of detachment or distance from the topic.
* There is no explicit expression of emotion in the text.

Given these points, it seems that the speaker's comment does not reveal any strong emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The tone is more understated and abstract, which aligns with a neutral emotional response.

**neutral**

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses an idiomatic phrase that suggests they are commenting on the challenges of the current situation.
* There is no indication of strong emotions, such as anger or disgust, in the speaker's tone.
* The language used is somewhat abstract and philosophical, which may suggest a sense of introspection or contemplation.

Given these points, I would categorize the speaker's emotion as **neutral**.
