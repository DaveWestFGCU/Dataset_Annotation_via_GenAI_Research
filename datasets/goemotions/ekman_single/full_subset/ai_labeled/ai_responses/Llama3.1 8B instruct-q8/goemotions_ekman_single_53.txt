Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses an emoticon "lol" which indicates humor, but also sets a lighthearted tone.
* The phrase "The worst defense in the league?" suggests a negative opinion about something specific (in this case, likely a sports team's defensive performance).
* The word "tank" implies that the speaker thinks the team is intentionally performing poorly.

Most relevant emotion label: **anger**
 
Reasoning: Although the tone of the comment is lighthearted with the use of "lol", the underlying sentiment expressed by the speaker appears to be annoyance or frustration with the team's performance, which falls under anger.

* They then state that the team's defense is "the worst" in the league, which implies a strong negative opinion about their performance.
* The use of the phrase "its like we're trying to tank" further emphasizes their disappointment and frustration with the team's situation.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**. While the speaker may also be feeling surprise or frustration, the tone of their statement suggests a strong negative emotional response that aligns more closely with anger than other options.
