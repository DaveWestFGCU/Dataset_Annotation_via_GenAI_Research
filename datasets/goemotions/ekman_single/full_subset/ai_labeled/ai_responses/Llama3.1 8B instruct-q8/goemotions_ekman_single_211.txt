Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker explicitly states that they are "annoyed".
* The tone of the statement is casual and matter-of-fact.
* There is no apparent reference to any negative emotions beyond annoyance.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**. However, since the speaker specifically mentions being "annoyed" rather than feeling a strong sense of anger or hostility, it's worth noting that the emotion may be closer to mild frustration or irritation, which falls under the broader category of anger in this context.

But if we're forced to choose from the given categories and taking into account the closest related emotions:

* Anger is the most fitting category since annoyance is a milder form of anger.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker explicitly states they are "annoyed".
* The word choice "annoyed" suggests a mild but unpleasant emotional state.
* There is no indication of stronger emotions like anger or disgust.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label for the speaker's comment is **anger**, but since anger includes annoyance and disapproval, it fits.

Response 3:
Here are the important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions feeling "annoyed", which suggests a negative emotional state.
* The word "annoyed" is often used interchangeably with other emotions, but it typically implies a more mild or fleeting sense of frustration or irritation.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**. While annoyance is not as intense as anger, it can be seen as a milder form of this emotion. However, since "annoyed" is explicitly mentioned and considering the definitions provided, I would lean towards **anger** being the closest match.

That being said, if we were to categorize this response more strictly according to the example sentences provided, I might argue that it's actually closer to a neutral or mild expression of displeasure, which isn't listed among the options. However, based on the available choices and considering the speaker's explicit mention of feeling "annoyed", **anger** is the most relevant label.

(Note: Some users may interpret this response as more closely aligned with sadness, due to the use of the word "annoyed" in a way that suggests frustration or irritation. However, based on the definitions provided and considering the tone of the sentence, I believe **anger** is a more accurate choice.)
