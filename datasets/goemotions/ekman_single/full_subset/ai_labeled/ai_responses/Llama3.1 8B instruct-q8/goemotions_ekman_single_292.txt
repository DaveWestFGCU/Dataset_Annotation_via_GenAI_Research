* The speaker appears to be discussing legal matters and the application of constitutional principles.
* They mention that a specific approach or argument ("This") will not hold up in court, using the phrase "won't survive the first challenge".

Response 5:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is responding to a hypothetical scenario involving the Constitution and the Crown.
* The tone of the response suggests a sense of certainty and expertise in legal matters.
* The use of formal language, such as "burden" and "presumed innocent", implies a level of knowledge and seriousness.

Given these points, it appears that the speaker is expressing a sense of skepticism or confidence in the likelihood of success for the hypothetical scenario. This suggests that the speaker may be feeling neutral, as there is no apparent emotional tone of anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

However, upon closer analysis, the speaker's response implies a hint of criticism or skepticism towards the original post or comment, which could suggest a underlying emotion of **anger**. But overall, the tone is more critical and analytical than angry.
