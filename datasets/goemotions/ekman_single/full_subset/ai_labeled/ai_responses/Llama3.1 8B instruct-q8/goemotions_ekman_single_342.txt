Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker seems to be recommending watching an earlier season of a show.
* They express enthusiasm for the current season, but it's not clear if they're addressing someone who hasn't watched the show at all or someone who needs to catch up on previous seasons.
* The tone is encouraging and optimistic.

Given these points, the emotion that most people will feel the speaker may be feeling is:

**joy**

The speaker's use of enthusiastic language ("gets better and better") and encouragement ("you should go back and see what happened") suggests that they're genuinely excited about the show and want others to experience it as well. This aligns with the definition of joy, which includes enthusiasm and excitement.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is making a recommendation to re-watch a previous season of something, implying they enjoyed it.
* The phrase "gets better" suggests an improvement or progression that the speaker found positive.
* There is no negative language or tone in the comment.

Given these considerations, I would label the emotion as **joy**. The speaker's enthusiasm and encouragement for others to re-watch the previous season suggest a positive emotional state, which aligns with the definition of joy.
