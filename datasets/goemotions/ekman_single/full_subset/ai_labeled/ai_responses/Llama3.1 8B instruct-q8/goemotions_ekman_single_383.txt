Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions they don't have a problem with diversity.
* They express a preference for something not being "so obvious."
* The tone seems to be somewhat critical or disapproving.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is **disgust**.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions they don't have a problem with diversity.
* However, they express a desire for something (diversity being "obvious") to be different.
* The tone is somewhat critical or disapproving.

Given these considerations, the emotion that best fits this sentiment is:

**Disgust**

The reason for this label is that the speaker's comment implies a strong disapproval or distaste for something (in this case, diversity being "obvious"). While the emotion could also be interpreted as subtle annoyance or frustration, disgust seems to capture the essence of their reaction.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions that they don't have a problem with diversity, which suggests a neutral or positive stance.
* However, the phrase "I just wish it wasn't so obvious" indicates that there is something bothering them about the current state of diversity.
* The word "obvious" can imply a sense of discomfort or unease, suggesting that the speaker may be feeling some form of negative emotion.

Given these points, I would choose **disgust** as the most relevant emotion label. This is because the speaker's comment implies a distaste for something they perceive as excessive or in-your-face (the "obvious" diversity), rather than a more general complaint or frustration. The tone is not overtly angry or fearful, and it's not entirely neutral, so **disgust** seems like the most fitting label.
