Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker starts by apologizing with "haha" which often precedes an informal admission of mistake.
* The phrase "fat fingered it" is a colloquialism used to describe accidentally pressing the wrong key on a keyboard or touchscreen, implying a momentary lapse in attention.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**surprise**

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker starts with an apology, indicating they made a mistake.
* They use a lighthearted tone, using the phrase "haha" and referring to their error as a "fat finger".
* There is no indication of strong emotions such as anger or fear.

Given these points, the emotion most people will feel the speaker may be feeling is **joy**. The use of a lighthearted tone and self-deprecation suggests that the speaker is amused by their mistake rather than distressed.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker acknowledges making an error ("fat fingered it")
* They use humor to downplay their mistake ("haha")
* They correct themselves with the intended number (18)

Given these points, the speaker is more likely expressing **amusement**, but since amusement falls under the joy category, I would classify this as:

**joy**
