Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker's response is brief and lacks elaboration.
* The tone appears to be dismissive or nonchalant.
* The language used is neutral, without any obvious emotional connotation.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is: **neutral**. 

The brevity and lack of emotional expression in the speaker's comment suggest a neutral tone, neither expressing strong emotions like anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise, nor conveying a clear opinion or reaction.
