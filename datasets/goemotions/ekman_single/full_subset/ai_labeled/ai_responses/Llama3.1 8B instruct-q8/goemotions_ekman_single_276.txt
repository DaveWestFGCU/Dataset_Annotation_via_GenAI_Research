Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the statement is matter-of-fact and observational.
* There is no apparent criticism, offense, or excitement expressed.
* The speaker seems to be highlighting a perceived issue or discrepancy.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is: **surprise**.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker seems to be responding to a situation where they feel that something is being hidden from them.
* The tone is somewhat matter-of-fact, but with a hint of defensiveness or frustration.

Most relevant emotion label: **surprise**. The speaker's comment implies a sense of realization or astonishment that the thing they're not seeing is still happening, even if they're not actively looking at it.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker seems to be responding to a situation or statement that implies something is being hidden or obscured.
* They express a sense of skepticism or doubt about the idea that they are missing out on something if they don't directly observe it.

Given these points, the speaker's tone and language suggest a sense of **surprise**, as they seem to be questioning or challenging the idea presented. However, their response could also be interpreted as neutral, simply presenting an alternative perspective without expressing any strong emotion. 

After reevaluating the text, I believe the most relevant emotion label is **neutral** because the speaker's statement appears more like a calm and objective observation rather than an emotional expression of surprise or any other emotion.
