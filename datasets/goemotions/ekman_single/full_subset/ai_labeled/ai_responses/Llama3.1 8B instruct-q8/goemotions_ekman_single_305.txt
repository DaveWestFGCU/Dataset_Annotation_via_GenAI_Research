Record: "I'M HERE"
Llama3.1 8B instruct-q8

Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the comment is all capital letters, which can indicate emphasis or intensity.
* The simplicity of the comment suggests a direct and possibly reactive response.
* There is no clear context provided for why the speaker feels the need to declare their presence.

Given these factors, I would infer that the speaker may be feeling:

**surprise**
 
The emphasis on being present ("I'M HERE") implies that the speaker was perhaps not expecting to be addressed or considered in a conversation, and is now making their presence known. This sudden declaration suggests a sense of surprise or astonishment at being included or recognized.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker has all capital letters, which can indicate emphasis and intensity.
* The speaker's message is brief and direct.
* There is no apparent context or preceding conversation that would explain the reason behind the speaker's outburst.

Given these considerations, it appears that the speaker is reacting strongly to a situation or comment, but without more information about what prompted this reaction. However, given the brevity and intensity of the message, **ANGER** seems like the most likely emotion label for this response.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses all capital letters for their comment, which can be seen as an indication of strong emphasis and emotion.
* There is no clear context provided about what the speaker is responding to, but the use of all caps suggests a reaction to something specific.
* The language used is brief and lacks additional explanation or justification.

Given these points, it's likely that the speaker feels **anger**. The use of all capital letters and the brevity of the comment suggest a strong emotional response, which aligns with the definition of anger as a "strong feeling of displeasure" or antagonism.
