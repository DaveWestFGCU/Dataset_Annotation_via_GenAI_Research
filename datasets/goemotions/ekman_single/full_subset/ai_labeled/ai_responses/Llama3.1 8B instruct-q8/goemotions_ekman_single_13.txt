Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is commenting on a situation where something is being referred to as a "meme," which implies it's a humorous or ironic reference.
* The speaker mentions that this "meme" involves calling British people "ugly."
* The tone of the comment seems to be observational rather than emotional.

Given these points, I would infer that the speaker is simply reporting on the content of the meme without expressing any strong emotion. The use of the word "ironically" suggests a sense of detachment or dry observation.

**neutral**

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker appears to be commenting on a meme that they find objectionable.
* They mention that the meme is "ironically" calling British people "ugly", suggesting that the humor may not land well with them.

Given these points, it's likely that the speaker finds the meme off-putting or unpleasant. However, since there is no strong language of disapproval or revulsion, we can rule out **disgust**.

The tone of the comment also doesn't convey a sense of fear, anger, joy, or surprise. The speaker seems to be simply expressing their reaction to the meme, without any emotional intensity.

Therefore, the most relevant emotion label is:

* **neutral**

Most relevant emotion label: **disgust**
