Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker seems to be responding to someone's comment that is being overly enthusiastic or congratulatory.
* The tone of the speaker appears to be mocking or sarcastic towards the other commenter's sentiment.
* The use of "Maaan" and "o man" suggests a playful but slightly annoyed tone.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label for the speaker's comment would be:

**surprise**, likely tinged with a sense of annoyance or mockery.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is responding to a congratulatory comment made by someone else.
* The tone of the response seems sarcastic and dismissive.

Based on these points, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**. The use of "Maaan o man" in an exaggerated and mocking way suggests that the speaker is feeling annoyed or irritated by the congratulatory comment, which may be perceived as insincere or over-the-top.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker seems to be responding to a situation where someone is being overly congratulatory or admiring of something.
* The tone of the response appears sarcastic and mocking.
* The use of "Maaan o man" at the end of the sentence suggests a sense of irony or ridicule.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label for this speaker's comment is **surprise**. However, upon closer inspection, it seems more likely that the speaker is expressing **disgust**, as they seem to be mocking and ridiculing someone's behavior rather than being genuinely surprised.

Response 4:
Here are the important points to consider:

* The speaker appears to be reacting to someone's response in a congratulatory manner.
* The use of "Maaan o man" seems to convey a tone of incredulity and possibly annoyance at the other person's comment.

Given these points, I would conclude that the emotion most people will feel the speaker may be feeling is:

**anger**

The reason for this choice is that the speaker's reaction seems to be directed at someone else's behavior or comment, which they find annoying or frustrating. The use of "Maaan o man" conveys a sense of incredulity and possibly even anger at the other person's congratulatory comment, especially if it was seen as insincere or over-the-top.
