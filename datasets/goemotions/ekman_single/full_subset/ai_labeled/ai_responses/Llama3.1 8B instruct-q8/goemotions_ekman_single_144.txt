Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker appears to be expressing frustration or exasperation.
* The phrase "already so delayed" suggests that something is taking too long.
* There is no explicit language of anger, disgust, fear, joy, or surprise in the comment.

Given these points, I would choose the emotion label **sadness** as the most relevant. However, it's worth noting that sadness can sometimes overlap with frustration or exasperation, which may be a more accurate description of the speaker's emotional state in this case. Nonetheless, within the given categories, I would select **sadness**, assuming the speaker is expressing disappointment or frustration due to the delay.

Alternative option: If you interpret the comment as more neutral, it could simply be a statement of fact without any expressed emotion. In that case, the label would be **neutral**.

Response 2:
To determine the emotion the speaker may be feeling, let's consider the following points:

* The phrase "If it weren't already" suggests that something is already in a state of delay.
* The word "delayed" has a negative connotation, implying that the situation is unfavorable or frustrating.
* The tone of the comment seems to express resignation and frustration rather than excitement or enthusiasm.

Given these points, I would conclude that the speaker is expressing a negative emotion towards a situation that they are experiencing. The most relevant emotion label for this comment is **sadness**.

However, considering alternative emotions:

* Anger: While the tone could be interpreted as angry, it seems more like frustration than full-blown anger.
* Disgust: There's no indication of revulsion or strong disapproval in the comment.
* Fear: The comment doesn't express fear or anxiety about a specific situation.
* Joy: This emotion is clearly not present in the comment.
* Surprise: While the speaker might be surprised that the delay has occurred, this isn't explicitly stated.
* Neutral: The tone of the comment is not neutral; it's more negative than that.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker seems to be commenting on a situation that has gone past its expected completion time.
* The tone of the comment is brief and to the point, with no apparent emotional language.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label for this speaker's sentiment is:

**sadness**

This is because the speaker appears to be expressing frustration or disappointment about something being delayed, which aligns with feelings of sadness.
