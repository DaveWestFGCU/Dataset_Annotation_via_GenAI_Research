Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses an expression of disgust ("Ugh"), which suggests that they are reacting negatively to something.
* The phrase "What a way to go" implies that the speaker is commenting on someone's death or demise, which is likely to evoke a strong emotional response.

Most relevant emotion label: **disgust**

Reasoning: While it's possible that the speaker could be feeling sadness or anger in response to the situation, the use of "Ugh" and the phrase "What a way to go" suggests a stronger sense of revulsion or distaste. This is more characteristic of disgust than any other emotion category.
