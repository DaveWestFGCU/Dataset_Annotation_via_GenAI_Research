Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker makes a comparison between the person and a televangelist, which implies a negative connotation.

Given these considerations, the emotion most people will feel the speaker may be feeling is **disgust**. This is because the speaker's comparison of the person to a televangelist implies that they find the person to be insincere or manipulative, which can evoke feelings of disgust in others.
