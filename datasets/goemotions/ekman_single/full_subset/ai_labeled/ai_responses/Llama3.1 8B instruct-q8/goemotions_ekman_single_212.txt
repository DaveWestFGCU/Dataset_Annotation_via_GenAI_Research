Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the sentence is brief and enigmatic.
* There is no explicit emotion expressed, but the words used could be interpreted as ominous or foreboding.
* The context is unclear, which makes it difficult to determine the intended emotional tone.

Given these considerations, I would categorize the speaker's emotion as:

**fear**
The sentence "They must have seen you" has a sense of impending danger or consequence, which is often associated with feelings of fear.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the sentence is brief and direct.
* The use of the third person ("they") implies a level of detachment or objectivity.
* The statement implies that someone's actions or intentions were observed, but it doesn't specify whether those actions are positive or negative.

Given these points, the emotion most people will feel the speaker may be feeling is **surprise**. The speaker seems to be commenting on an unexpected development, which suggests a sense of surprise or astonishment.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker seems to be implying that someone has been watching them.
* The tone of the statement is brief and direct, without any explicit emotion expressed.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label for this comment is **fear**. This is because the speaker's implication that they are being watched suggests a sense of vulnerability or apprehension, which aligns with the definition of fear as an emotional response to a perceived threat or danger.
