Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions receiving insults from someone else.
* They mention that the other person's response (a TV show) has proven their original statement to be true.
* The tone of the comment is defensive and assertive.

Based on these points, it appears that the speaker is feeling a sense of validation and vindication after being insulted by someone else. This suggests that they are experiencing a positive emotional state in response to the other person's attempt to undermine them.

**joy**

This label may seem counterintuitive given the context of insults, but the speaker's tone and language suggest that they are feeling a sense of satisfaction and triumph over their opponent. They use phrases like "proves what I said" and "nothing more nothing less," which imply a sense of confidence and conviction. Overall, while the initial insult may have been unpleasant, the speaker's response suggests that they are experiencing joy or pleasure in having their statement validated.

Response 2:
Here are some important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions receiving insults, which suggests they may be feeling defensive or upset.
* They claim their statement was proved true by a TV show, implying a sense of vindication.
* However, the tone seems confrontational and dismissive towards the other person, with phrases like "nothing more nothing less".

Given these points, I would say the most relevant emotion label is **anger**. The speaker's language suggests they are feeling strong emotions, likely annoyance or anger, in response to being insulted and having their statement disputed.

Response 3:
Here are some important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions "insults", which could indicate a negative tone.
* They mention that their previous statement has been proven true by a show, implying that they were correct in their assertion.
* The speaker's language is confrontational, using the phrase "now all you have".

Given these points, it appears that the speaker is expressing anger towards the person or people who are continuing to insult them. They seem to be frustrated that their previous statement has been validated by a show, and that they are still being attacked.

**anger**
