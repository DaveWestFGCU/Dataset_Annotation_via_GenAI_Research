Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The statement seems abstract and doesn't appear to be directly related to a specific event or person.
* There is no clear emotional tone, such as annoyance, revulsion, or pleasure.
* The phrase "time is meaningless" could suggest a philosophical or introspective perspective.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**neutral**

The statement seems to lack an expressed emotion and doesn't convey any strong feeling of displeasure, surprise, or excitement. It appears to be more of a thought-provoking comment rather than an emotional response.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker's statement seems to be a philosophical or existential observation rather than a reaction to a specific event or person.
* The use of the word "meaningless" implies a sense of detachment or nihilism.

Given these considerations, I would categorize the emotion as **sadness**. The speaker's comment suggests a bleak and pessimistic view of time, which is often associated with feelings of sadness, despair, and hopelessness.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is responding to an idea or statement made by someone else.
* They use a phrase that seems philosophical and abstract ("time is meaningless").
* There's no apparent emotional tone or language that suggests a personal attachment or investment in the topic.

Given these points, I would categorize the speaker's emotion as:

**neutral**

The reason for this is that the speaker's statement doesn't contain any language or tone that indicates they're feeling strongly about the idea. It's more of a matter-of-fact comment or a statement of observation, rather than an expression of passion or emotional investment.
