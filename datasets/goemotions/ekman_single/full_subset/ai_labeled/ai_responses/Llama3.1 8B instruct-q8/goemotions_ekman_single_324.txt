Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker appears to be making a humorous or sarcastic remark.
* The context of the conversation is unclear, but it seems that the speaker is responding to a previous comment or post with a joke or a play on words.
* The tone of the comment is likely lighthearted and teasing.

Given these points, the emotion most people will feel the speaker may be feeling is:

**surprise**

The speaker's comment "Remind me! 6 months" could be interpreted as a humorous way to say that they've forgotten something or that time has passed quickly. The use of a question mark at the end of the sentence adds a touch of playfulness, suggesting that the speaker is trying to be witty or clever.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the sentence appears to be casual and conversational.
* The language used is direct and simple, with no apparent emotional intensity.
* The speaker seems to be asking for a reminder about something that happened six months ago.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**neutral**

The reason I choose neutral is that there doesn't seem to be any strong emotional undertone in the sentence. The speaker is simply asking for a reminder, which suggests a lack of emotional investment or reaction.
