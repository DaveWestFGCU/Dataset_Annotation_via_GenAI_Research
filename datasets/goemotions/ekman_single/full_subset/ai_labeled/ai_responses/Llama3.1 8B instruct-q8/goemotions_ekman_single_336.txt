Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses the word "Yikes", which can be an expression of alarm or shock.
* The phrase "hope he's okay" implies concern for someone's well-being.

Given these considerations, the emotion label that fits best is: **concern** -> however, I will choose from the provided options and select sadness as it most closely relates to a negative emotional state associated with concern or worry. 

However, another more fitting option may be surprise (given the use of "Yikes" which can imply shock or alarm) but since that was not my first choice here is an alternative selection:

**sadness**
