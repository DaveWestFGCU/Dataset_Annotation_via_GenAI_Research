Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the comment is dismissive and condescending.
* The phrase "nobody expects much from you people anyways" implies a lack of respect or expectation for the abilities or achievements of the person or group being addressed.
* The use of the word "anyways" suggests a casual, almost careless attitude.

**anger**

The speaker's tone and language suggest that they are annoyed or irritated with the person or group they are addressing, and are expressing this displeasure in a somewhat aggressive manner.
