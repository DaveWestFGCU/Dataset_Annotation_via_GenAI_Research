Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker seems to be offering advice to someone who is likely experiencing difficulties related to the person's absence.
* The tone of the comment appears to be somewhat callous and dismissive, suggesting that the speaker does not have a strong emotional investment in the situation or the person involved.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label for the speaker is:

**sadness**

This is because the speaker's comment comes across as lacking empathy or understanding, which is often associated with sadness. The tone of the comment suggests that the speaker may be trying to distance themselves from the emotional pain of the situation, which is a common coping mechanism for people experiencing sadness.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker's tone is somewhat cryptic and sarcastic, as they're making a statement that could be interpreted in multiple ways.
* The phrase "Enjoy it while you can" suggests that the speaker believes the absence of this person will not last forever.
* The overall message seems to convey a sense of resigned acceptance or even gloating.

Most relevant emotion label: **sadness**

Reasoning: While the speaker's tone is sarcastic, the underlying sentiment appears to be one of sadness or melancholy. The speaker's comment implies that they believe the person's absence will eventually come to an end, and they're somewhat bitter about this prospect. This bitterness is reminiscent of the emotional pain associated with sadness.
