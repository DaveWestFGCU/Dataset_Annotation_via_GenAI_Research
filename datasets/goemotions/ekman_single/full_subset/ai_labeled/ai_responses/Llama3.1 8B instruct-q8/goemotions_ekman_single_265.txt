Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions almost downvoting the original poster, which suggests they were considering taking an action against the post.
* The tone of the speaker's response is playful and teasing, using a dramatic phrase "Boooooooo!" that implies mock disapproval rather than genuine anger.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label for this text is:

**surprise**
 
However, I must note that while surprise isn't the only possible answer, it seems to be a strong contender. The playful tone and use of dramatic language ("Boooooooo!") might also suggest **joy**, but given the context, **surprise** seems more fitting as the speaker appears to be responding with mock indignation rather than genuine pleasure.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions they were about to downvote, which implies a negative reaction.
* The use of the word "Boooooooo!" is an onomatopoeic expression often used to convey disapproval or mocking.
* The tone appears to be playful and lighthearted.

Based on these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**anger**

However, considering the speaker's tone seems more playful than genuinely angry, it could also be interpreted as a form of mock anger or teasing. Nevertheless, among the given options, **anger** is the closest match.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions being close to downvoting the original poster.
* The phrase "Boooooooo!" is used, which has an ominous and dismissive tone.

Given these points, the speaker's reaction is more playful than genuinely angry. The use of "Boooooooo!" suggests a tongue-in-cheek approach, rather than a serious expression of displeasure.

**joy**

The speaker's intention appears to be lighthearted and amusing, rather than genuinely upset or annoyed.
