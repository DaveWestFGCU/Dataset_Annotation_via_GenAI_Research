Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses the word "terrified", which implies a strong emotional response.
* The speaker is referring to themselves, suggesting self-awareness and possibly vulnerability.
* The tone is somewhat introspective and honest.

Given these considerations, I would label the emotion as: **sadness**

The reason for this classification is that the speaker's statement suggests they are struggling with their own emotions or thoughts, and "terrified" implies a sense of emotional pain or distress. This aligns more closely with the definition of sadness than any other emotion category provided.

* The speaker mentions feeling "terrified", which suggests a strong emotional state.
* The subject of fear is the self, which can be a unique and potentially unsettling topic.
* The speaker uses a phrase that implies they are drawing comfort from knowing someone else shares their feelings.

Given these considerations, I would categorize the speaker's emotion as: **fear**.
