Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions being "surprised" by an outcome.
* The tone seems reflective and matter-of-fact, rather than emotional or confrontational.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is: **surprise**. 

The reason for this choice is that the speaker explicitly states they would have been surprised if a certain event had not occurred (i.e., someone being cleared in California). This suggests that their comment is primarily driven by a reaction to an unexpected outcome, which aligns with the definition of surprise.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is responding to a situation where someone has been cleared of a charge.
* The tone seems somewhat matter-of-fact and unsurprised by the outcome.

Given these points, it appears that the speaker is not expressing a strong emotion about the situation. They seem to be accepting or expecting the outcome, rather than being surprised or upset.

**neutral**
