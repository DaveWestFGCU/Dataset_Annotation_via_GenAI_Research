Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker has written just a single word, "*Wow*", which is an exclamation.
* There is no clear context for the comment, but it appears to be reacting to something surprising or unexpected.

Given these considerations, I would identify the emotion as **surprise**. The use of the word "Wow" with an asterisk surrounding it suggests that the speaker is trying to convey a sense of astonishment or shock.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses an exclamation mark at the end of their statement, which often indicates excitement or emphasis.
* The statement "*Wow*" is very short and lacks context, making it difficult to determine the intended emotion.

Given these considerations, I would classify the speaker's emotion as **surprise**. The use of "Wow" can be seen as an expression of astonishment or shock at something unexpected, which aligns with the definition of surprise.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses "*Wow*" which suggests a strong reaction.
* There are no explicit words expressing emotion, but the exclamation mark after "Wow" indicates a heightened emotional state.

Given these points, I would categorize this comment as being in response to something unexpected or remarkable. 

**surprise**
