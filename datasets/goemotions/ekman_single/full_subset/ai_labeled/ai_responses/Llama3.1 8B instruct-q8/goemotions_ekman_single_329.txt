Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is responding to someone else's comment about the live chat.
* The person in the live chat was confused by the showcase of a Scarlet skin.
* The speaker seems to be highlighting this confusion, rather than expressing their own opinion.

Given these points, it appears that the speaker is more focused on sharing an unexpected or surprising piece of information, rather than expressing any strong emotion themselves. They are presenting a neutral or observational tone.

However, if we look closer at the language used and the context, there might be a hint of surprise or even amusement in the way the speaker phrases their comment ("how he actually got confused"). This could suggest that the speaker is surprised by the person's confusion, but still maintains a relatively neutral tone overall.

**surprise**

Note: The speaker's tone is mostly neutral, but the use of "actually" and the phrasing of the sentence might imply a hint of surprise or amusement. However, it's not strong enough to be classified as any other emotion besides surprise.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker appears to be discussing a gaming-related event, specifically a live stream with a Scarlet skin showcase.
* They mention someone else's comment in the live chat, which suggests that the speaker is responding to a previous conversation or post.
* The tone of the comment seems casual and matter-of-fact.

Given these points, it's likely that the speaker is expressing a neutral emotion. There doesn't seem to be any strong feeling of displeasure (anger), revulsion (disgust), fear, joy, sadness, or surprise in the speaker's comment. They're simply sharing information about someone else's comment and don't appear to be emotionally invested in the topic.

**neutral**
