Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker seems to be addressing someone who didn't respond or interact with them.
* They mention the possibility of the person having a bad day, implying some level of understanding and empathy.
* However, they also express a desire for a simple greeting, which could suggest a sense of being overlooked or disregarded.

Given these points, the speaker's tone appears to be slightly disappointed or frustrated, but not strongly so. They are more likely expressing a mild expectation that was not met, rather than intense anger or disgust.

**sadness**

Reasoning: The speaker seems to be expressing a minor disappointment and possibly feeling overlooked by someone they were expecting to interact with. While it's not a strong expression of sadness, the tone is more melancholic than anything else, fitting the sadness category.
