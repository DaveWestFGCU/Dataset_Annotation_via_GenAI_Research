Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The language used by the speaker is aggressive ("Oh fuck off") and dismissive.
* The tone of the comment is confrontational, with an air of hostility towards someone not mentioned in the post (implied to be a political figure).
* The speaker seems to be frustrated or impatient that this person has not been exposed as a President.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**anger**

The speaker's use of profanity and aggressive language suggests a strong feeling of displeasure or antagonism towards someone or something.
