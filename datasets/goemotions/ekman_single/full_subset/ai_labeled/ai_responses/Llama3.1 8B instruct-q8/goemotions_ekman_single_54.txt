------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is qualifying what they mean by "masculinity" as distinct from something else.
* They are using the phrase "of course," which can imply a tone of being forced to make this distinction or that it's obvious.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is **disgust**. 

Reasoning: The speaker's use of phrases like "non-harmful, non-toxic" and their implication that there are bad forms of masculinity suggest they are reacting with strong disapproval to something. This reaction is similar to examples of disgust in the given definitions.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker appears to be sarcastic and tongue-in-cheek, as they're using phrases like "of course" in a way that suggests the opposite is true.
* They're trying to make a point about the distinction between healthy and unhealthy masculinity, which implies they may be critiquing or mocking traditional notions of masculinity.
* The tone is somewhat ironic and playful, but also slightly condescending.

Given these points, the speaker's tone is likely not meant to be taken at face value. However, based on their sarcastic and slightly condescending language, I would argue that the speaker may be feeling **anger** towards traditional notions of masculinity, which they're trying to critique and subvert through their sarcasm.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses phrases such as "regular" and "everyday" to emphasize the distinction between two concepts.
* The phrase "non-harmful, non-toxic" is added to further clarify the intended meaning.
* The tone seems to be somewhat sarcastic or ironic.

Given these points, it appears that the speaker may be expressing a sense of irony or sarcasm in their response. However, considering the context and language used, I would identify the emotion most relevant to this situation as:

**anger**

The speaker's use of phrases such as "non-harmful" and "non-toxic" suggests that they are responding to an argument or criticism that has been made against a particular form of masculinity. The tone is likely meant to convey a sense of frustration or annoyance, which aligns with the emotion category of anger.
