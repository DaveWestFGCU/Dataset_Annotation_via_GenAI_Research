Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions their own relationship duration, emphasizing how long they've been with their partner.
* They use a dismissive phrase ("Psh") to express disapproval or frustration towards someone else's relationship length.

Given the tone and language used by the speaker, it appears that they are expressing annoyance or disdain for the person's comment about their short-term relationship. This is likely due to the speaker feeling like their own relationship is more significant and enduring than the other person's.

**anger**
