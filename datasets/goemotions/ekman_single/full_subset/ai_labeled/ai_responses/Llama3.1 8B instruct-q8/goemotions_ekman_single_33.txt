Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions that most of the shots were "pretty poor", implying a negative evaluation.
* However, they also mention "couple of great saves" which suggests a positive note in an otherwise negative assessment.

Considering these points, it seems that the speaker's tone is mostly critical but with a hint of appreciation for some specific instances. 

Given this analysis, **neutral** is not the best fit because the speaker does express an opinion and evaluates the shots negatively.
The most relevant emotion label is: **sadness**
 
Reasoning: Although the comment isn't extremely negative or sad, it does have a somewhat critical tone that might be associated with disappointment.
