Important points to consider:

Response 2:
Here are some important points to consider given the text:

* The speaker is commenting on someone else's voting behavior.
* They mention that this person "tends to" outvote another person, suggesting a pattern or trend.
* There doesn't appear to be any strong language or emotion expressed in the comment.

Given these points, I would conclude that the speaker's tone is neutral and observational. However, the fact that they are commenting on someone else's behavior could suggest a slightly passive-aggressive or mildly critical tone. But overall, there is no clear expression of anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise in this comment.

Therefore, my answer is:

**neutral**
