* The tone appears confrontational, with a hint of pride or confidence in their argument.

* The speaker appears to be emphasizing a contrast between themselves and others.

Most relevant emotion label: **anger** (or possibly **disgust**, as the speaker's tone has a slightly dismissive and critical quality). However, given the context of the sentence (a defensive response), anger seems like a more fitting choice.
