Response 1:
Here are the important points to consider:

* The speaker uses an exclamation mark and the word "damn", which suggests strong emotion.
* The speaker mentions two names, implying that they have some connection or relationship with these individuals.
* The speaker's tone is informal and somewhat aggressive.

Given these considerations, I believe the most relevant emotion label is: **anger**.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The language used by the speaker includes an expletive ("damn") and an expression of frustration ("damn it").
* The tone is abrupt and emphatic, suggesting strong emotions.
* The comment is directed at a specific person ([NAME]), implying that there is a personal or interpersonal issue involved.

Based on these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**anger**

The speaker's use of profanity and exasperation ("damn it") suggests that they are feeling angry or frustrated with [NAME].
