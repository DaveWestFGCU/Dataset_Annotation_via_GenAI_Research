Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the statement is casual and dismissive.
* The phrase "you guys" suggests a sense of detachment or non-involvement.
* The quote marks around "nah you guys go ahead" imply that the speaker is quoting someone else, possibly with irony or sarcasm.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is:

**neutral**

The statement appears to be a neutral or dismissive response, lacking in expressed emotion. The tone and language used do not convey strong feelings of anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the sentence appears dismissive and possibly passive-aggressive.
* The phrase "you guys go ahead" can be interpreted as giving permission but also implying that the speaker is not interested or invested in what others are doing.
* The use of quotation marks around "nah you guys go ahead" may indicate irony or sarcasm.

Given these points, it seems that the speaker is expressing a tone that is neutral but with a hint of annoyance or disapproval. However, since there's no explicit expression of anger or any other strong emotion, the most fitting label is:

**neutral**

However, considering the possible undertones and subtle implications in the sentence, another interpretation could be that the speaker is feeling annoyed or disapproving, which would classify as **anger**, but given the context, it seems more likely to be neutral.
