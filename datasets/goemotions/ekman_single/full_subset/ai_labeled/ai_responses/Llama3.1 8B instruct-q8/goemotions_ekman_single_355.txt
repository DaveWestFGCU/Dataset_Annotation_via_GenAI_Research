Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions that a comment has been removed.
* The reason for removal is due to breaking a specific rule (#8).
* There is no indication of the content of the removed comment or its impact on the speaker.

Given these considerations, it's likely that the speaker is expressing frustration or annoyance at the removal of the comment. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact emotion. The most relevant emotion label in this case is:

**neutral**
 
The reason for choosing neutral is that there's no indication of strong emotions like anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise in the speaker's response. They simply state a fact (the comment was removed) and provide a reason (breaking rule #8).
