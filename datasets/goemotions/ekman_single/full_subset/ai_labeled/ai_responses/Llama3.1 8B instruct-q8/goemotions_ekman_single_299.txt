Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses strong language ("Damn") and an exclamation mark to emphasize their disappointment.
* They express surprise at not seeing something they expected (monkeys) in the location they visited.
* Their tone is critical, implying that they feel cheated or misled.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **disappointment**. However, since disappointment is a subset of sadness, and given that the speaker's tone is more critical than sorrowful, I would categorize this comment as expressing **anger**, albeit in a more reactive form (being disappointed or let down).

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker expresses disappointment and frustration with their experience.
* They mention not seeing something they expected to see ("monkeys").
* The tone is critical and negative.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label for this comment is **disappointment**. However, since disappointment can sometimes be related to sadness, but in this case, it's more about a feeling of being misled or deceived, I would categorize it as **anger**, with a sense of injustice or frustration.

So, my final answer is: **anger**

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker expresses disappointment and frustration with their experience.
* They mention not seeing something they expected to see ("monkeys").
* The tone is critical and negative.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **disappointment**. However, since "disappointment" is a subset of sadness (emotional pain or sorrow), and the speaker's tone is more frustrated than sorrowful, I would categorize it as a form of anger, but specifically:

**anger**

However, given the options and considering the context, the closest match would be **sadness**, as disappointment is a key component of the speaker's emotional state.

But upon closer review, the speaker seems to be more frustrated than sorrowful, so I'd say the most fitting emotion label is actually **anger**.
