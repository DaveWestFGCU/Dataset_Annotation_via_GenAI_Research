------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker mentions "autistic meltdowns", which may imply a lack of understanding or sensitivity towards individuals with autism.
* The phrase "immense fear of vomiting" suggests that the speaker is highlighting a perceived vulnerability or distress in others, rather than expressing empathy or concern.
* The tone is dismissive and somewhat flippant, implying that the commenter's experiences are not taken seriously.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**disgust**

The speaker's comment comes across as insensitive and judgmental, which aligns with the definition of disgust as a strong disapproval or revulsion towards something unpleasant. The tone is not one of concern or empathy, but rather a dismissive and somewhat mocking attitude towards individuals who may be experiencing distressing situations.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker describes someone as having a condition (autistic meltdown), implying a perceived vulnerability.
* The speaker associates this condition with a specific bodily function (vomiting).
* The tone seems dismissive and reducing.

Given these points, the speaker's comment suggests a lack of empathy or understanding, which is not accompanied by any visible anger, disgust, fear, joy, or sadness. Instead, it appears to be a callous observation.

**neutral**

Note that this label may seem counterintuitive given the context, but it reflects the absence of an expressed emotion beyond a neutral or dismissive tone.
