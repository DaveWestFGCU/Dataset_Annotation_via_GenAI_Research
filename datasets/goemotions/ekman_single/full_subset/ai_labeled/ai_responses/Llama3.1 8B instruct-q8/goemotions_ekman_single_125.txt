Response 1:
Here are the important points to consider given the text:

* The speaker uses the phrase "LOL" which is typically an expression of amusement or laughter.
* However, the tone quickly shifts with the use of "BS", which implies a strong sense of disapproval.
* The speaker's response also includes "call BS!", which means to reject or dismiss something as false.

Considering these points, it appears that the speaker is expressing a mix of amusement and strong disapproval. However, since the tone is primarily one of disapproval, I would categorize the emotion most people will feel the speaker may be feeling as:

**anger**

Note: The use of "BS" implies a sense of annoyance or frustration, which aligns with the definition of anger.
