Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the comment is casual and informal.
* The language used is colloquial ("Lol" is an abbreviation for "laugh out loud").
* The comment appears to be responding to another commenter or post, but the context is not provided.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is:

**disgust**
 
The speaker's use of "creepy" suggests that they find Mike unpleasant or disturbing. However, the tone of the comment is more playful and humorous ("Lol") than overtly angry or fearful. The speaker does not seem to be strongly disapproving or revulsed by Mike, but rather amused or entertained by his presence in a way that implies something is off about him. This suggests a tone of mild disgust or distaste, which aligns with the definition of disgust as "revulsion or strong disapproval" (albeit in a more casual and playful manner).

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker uses a colloquial expression "Lol" which can indicate a lighthearted tone.
* The phrase "always a creepy mike" is a subjective evaluation of someone's behavior or appearance, implying that the speaker finds this person unsettling.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **surprise**, as the comment suggests that the speaker has come to expect Mike's behavior to be weird or unsettling. However, it's also possible to interpret the tone as more playful and teasing than genuinely surprised.

Alternatively, one could argue that the tone is neutral, but given the use of "creepy" which implies a negative evaluation, I lean towards **surprise** as the most fitting emotion label.
