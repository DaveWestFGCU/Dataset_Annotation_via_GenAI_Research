Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The speaker is expressing gratitude towards someone who provided information about the DVD.
* The tone of the comment seems polite and appreciative.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is **gratitude**, but since that option is not available, I would choose **joy** as it includes admiration, approval, and appreciation, which are all present in this comment. However, if we had to choose from the provided options, the closest match would be **neutral**, as the speaker's tone is polite and appreciative, but not strongly expressing any other emotion.

Response 3:
Here are the important points to consider when analyzing the speaker's emotion:

* The speaker mentions that the DVD is "pretty hard to come by", which suggests that they were struggling to find it or had been looking for it.
* They express gratitude to the commenter who provided information about the DVD, using the phrase "thank you though I appreciate it".
* The tone of the comment seems polite and courteous.

Given these points, the speaker appears to be feeling grateful or appreciative towards the commenter. However, none of the given emotion categories exactly match this description, but based on the options provided, I would say that the speaker is likely feeling **joy** (specifically, gratitude), as joy includes emotions such as appreciation and thanks.

It's worth noting that "joy" might not be a perfect fit here, as it typically implies a stronger sense of happiness or pleasure. However, in this context, the speaker seems to be expressing genuine gratitude towards the commenter, which is closer to joy than any other option.
