Response 1:
In this comment, the speaker appears to be defending someoneâ€™s actions or choices, expressing confusion or disagreement with the use of the term "disgusting." This indicates a reaction against a perceived negative judgment. The speaker's tone suggests they find the label unjust and are advocating for a more understanding perspective regarding natural bodily functions, which may indicate a level of annoyance towards the original comment's view.

The comment lacks elements of fear, joy, sadness, or surprise as it focuses on challenging a negative viewpoint rather than expressing a broader emotional response.

Considering these points, the most relevant emotion label would be **anger**.
