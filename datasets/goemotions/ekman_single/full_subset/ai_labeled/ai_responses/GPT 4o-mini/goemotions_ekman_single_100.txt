In analyzing the speaker's comment, several important points can be considered:

1. **Tone and Context**: The question posed expresses disbelief or amazement at the notion that someone has never experienced the embarrassment of an accident as an adult. The use of "never" emphasizes a strong reaction to the idea being presented.

Response 3:
In analyzing the speaker's comment, several points stand out:

1. **Shock Factor**: The speaker's rhetorical questioning suggests they find the idea of never having experienced such an embarrassing situation (shitting oneself as an adult) surprising or hard to believe.
2. **Relatability**: The speaker implies that this experience is a common human experience, indicating that they may feel a mix of incredulity and a sort of humor in the shared nature of such embarrassing moments.
3. **Tone of Amusement**: The informal language and choice of words ("shit yourself") suggest a light-hearted approach rather than a serious criticism, which adds a layer of unexpected amusement.
4. **Contrasting Experiences**: The comparison between adults and kids in the context of an embarrassing incident may also indicate the speaker's attempt to normalize the situation, making it seem less severe.

Considering these points, the emotion that captures the speaker's sentiment best is one of **surprise** at the assertion made by the commentee. They seem astonished and slightly amused by the claim being presented.

Thus, the most relevant emotion label is **surprise**.
