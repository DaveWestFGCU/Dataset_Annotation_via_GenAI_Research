Response 1:
In this comment, the speaker expresses a feeling of longing or desire for things they wish to have but acknowledges that they can only hope or pray for them, suggesting a sense of helplessness. The mention of praying indicates a yearning for change or improvement in oneâ€™s circumstances, which aligns more with a feeling of sadness due to the unfulfilled desires and the reliance on hope. There's a lack of anger, disgust, or joy present in the statement. 

The use of "all we can do is pray" signifies a sense of resignation that points towards emotional pain or disappointment in the current situation.

Thus, the most relevant emotion label here is **sadness**.

Response 2:
In analyzing the speaker's comment, several important points can be considered:

1. **Desire vs. Frustration**: The speaker expresses a strong desire for everything mentioned but contrasts it with the statement about only being able to pray. This indicates a sense of longing or yearning for something that feels out of reach.

2. **Helplessness**: The phrase "all we can do is pray" suggests a feeling of helplessness, as if the speaker recognizes that their desires are dependent on external factors beyond their control.

3. **Tone**: The overall tone reads as somewhat somber, highlighting a wishfulness that is tinged with resignation, which can often accompany feelings of sadness.

Given these points, the emotion that best encapsulates the speaker's sentiment is likely **sadness**, as there is a clear expression of longing coupled with a sense of helplessness. 

Thus, the most relevant emotion label is **sadness**.
