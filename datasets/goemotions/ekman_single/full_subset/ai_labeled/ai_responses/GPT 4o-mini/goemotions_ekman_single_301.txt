Response 1:
In analyzing the speaker's comment, we can infer a few key points:

1. **Tone**: The speaker's use of "not really" suggests a dismissive or corrective tone, indicating that they are responding to a misconception or over-exaggeration made by another party.

2. **Content**: The mention of Winnipeg's population in comparison to Tokyo suggests frustration with an assumption that may have been made regarding the size or significance of their city.

3. **Implied Emotion**: Given the context and phrasing, the speaker may be expressing a level of irritation or displeasure towards the comparison being made, which indicates a strong sentiment against the implication made about their city.

Considering these points, the most relevant emotion that the speaker is likely feeling in this comment is **anger**. The commentary reflects a level of annoyance towards an incorrect assumption and a corrective response to it.

Thus, the emotion label for the speaker's feeling would be **anger**.

Response 2:
In this comment, the speaker appears to be responding to a statement or claim made by someone else regarding a comparison between Winnipeg and Tokyo. They begin with "Not really," indicating disagreement or dismissal, which can suggest some level of annoyance. The follow-up about the population of Winnipeg as a clarification implies a sense of superiority in knowledge or a correction of the other person's misconception. The use of "sorry" might soften the statement slightly, but it still carries an edge of condescension.

Key points to consider:
- The phrase "Not really" signals disagreement or dismissal, which can indicate annoyance.
- The clarification regarding population differences suggests a corrective tone, possibly hinting at frustration with a perceived misunderstanding.
- The use of "sorry" indicates an attempt to soften the blow but does not fully negate the underlying displeasure.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion that the speaker may be expressing is annoyance or displeasure in response to the previous comment or post.
