Response 1:
In this comment, the speaker expresses a mix of affection towards a person who made a statement deemed silly or ill-conceived. The term "daft" conveys a sense of ridicule towards the analogy, indicating that the speaker finds it nonsensical. The phrase “like that isn't the point” suggests that the speaker feels the person's focus on the literal interpretation is misguided, hinting at either an appreciation for the intent behind the analogy or frustration at the misunderstanding.

Key points to consider:
- The use of "love" indicates a positive feeling towards the person being referenced.
- The word "daft" suggests disapproval or mockery of the analogy itself.
- The reference to the analogy's point implies some form of acknowledgment that there's a deeper meaning that is being overlooked, which could evoke mild irritation.

Combining these points, the primary emotion appears to stem from a combination of enjoyment of the person's perspective while also being critical of the misunderstanding. However, the overall tone reflects a playful engagement rather than outright anger or disgust.

Thus, the most relevant emotion label is **joy**.
