In this comment, the speaker seems to be expressing a sentiment that suggests disbelief or astonishment regarding the timeframe referenced in the conversation, which they find to be significantly outdated. The mention of "last century" in connection with "Star Wars" indicates a contrast between current expectations and historical context, and the use of an exclamation point adds to the intensity of the sentiment.
