Response 1:
The speaker's comment, "Thanks, it was no effort at all," conveys a sense of lightheartedness and ease regarding the action they are acknowledging, suggesting they didn't find it burdensome or challenging. The phrase "it was no effort at all" implies a relaxed demeanor, indicating that the speaker is comfortably engaging with the conversation. The expression of thanks shows appreciation, but there’s no deep emotional weight to the comment. 

Key points to consider:
- The use of "Thanks" indicates a polite acknowledgment.
- "It was no effort at all" reflects a casual, relaxed attitude rather than one weighted with strong emotion.
- There is no indication of negativity, such as anger, disgust, or fear.
- The overall tone is positive but doesn’t reach the level of joy; it feels more neutral.

Based on this analysis, the most relevant emotion label is **neutral**.

Response 3:
In this comment, the speaker expresses a sentiment that suggests they took little to no effort in response to something that was likely meant to be appreciated or thanked for.
