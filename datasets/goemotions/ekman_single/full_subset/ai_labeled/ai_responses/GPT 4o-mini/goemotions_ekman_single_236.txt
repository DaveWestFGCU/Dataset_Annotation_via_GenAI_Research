Response 1:
In this comment, the speaker expresses a mix of appreciation and criticism. They begin with a positive sentiment ("I like this") but then quickly shift to a more negative observation about the description failing to capture an unsettling aspect ("the horrifying rotting smell"). The use of "horrifying" suggests a strong negative reaction, pointing toward an emotional response to something unpleasant. Additionally, the phrase "It sounds sort of cute!" appears to create a contrast between the intended description and how the speaker interprets it, evoking a sense of revulsion or strong disapproval.

Given this analysis, the most relevant emotion is **disgust**.
