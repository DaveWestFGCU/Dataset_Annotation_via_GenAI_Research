GPT 4o-mini
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response 1:
The speaker seems to be expressing a mix of understanding and mild disappointment regarding someone's behavior. They acknowledge the possibility of the other person's circumstances (having a bad day) but also imply that there is an expectation for basic social interaction (at least say hi). The statement indicates a subtle critique of social etiquette without strong negative emotion. 

Key points to consider:
- The speaker exhibits a sense of empathy for the other person but is also frustrated or disappointed due to their lack of basic interaction.
- There is a balance between understanding and a desire for better social conduct.
- Overall, the tone is not overly emotional but conveys an expectation that is not being met.

Given these observations, the most relevant emotion label is **sadness** because the speaker's comment hints at disappointment in social interaction rather than anger, disgust, or outright disappointment.

Response 2:
In this comment, the speaker reflects on someone else's behavior while also offering a possible explanation for it ("Maybe she was having a bad day"). This suggests a sense of understanding or empathy towards the situation. However, the statement "But then again at least say hi" indicates some level of dissatisfaction or expectation regarding social interaction.

Key points to consider:
- The speaker acknowledges that the person might be having a difficult time, which shows an understanding tone and mitigates potential disapproval.
- The latter part implies a sense of disappointment that the expected social nicety (saying hi) was not fulfilled, which could evoke feelings of sadness or mild annoyance.
- Overall, the mixed tone of empathy and mild reproach indicates a lack of extreme emotions but a desire for better social engagement.

Based on the overall tone and content of the comment, the emotion that aligns most closely is one of mild disappointment or sadness in the context of social interactions.

**sadness**

Response 3:
In this comment, the speaker expresses a sense of understanding towards someone's behavior, indicating that the person might have been experiencing difficulties ("having a bad day"). However, there's also an expectation or disappointment reflected in the latter half of the comment, where the speaker suggests that the person should have at least acknowledged them ("at least say hi"). This mix of empathy toward the individual's situation and a subtle critique of their lack of courtesy suggests a feeling that aligns more with disappointment.

Key points to consider:
- The speaker acknowledges potential reasons for the other person's behavior (having a bad day) which shows compassion.
- The speaker also implies a desire for basic social interaction (saying hi), indicating some level of disappointment.

Considering these points, the emotion most relevant to the speaker's feelings in this context is **sadness**.
