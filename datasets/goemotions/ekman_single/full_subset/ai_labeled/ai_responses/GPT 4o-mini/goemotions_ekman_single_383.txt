Response 1:
In this comment, the speaker expresses a sentiment that combines a seemingly positive view on diversity with a critique that suggests discomfort or annoyance with how it is presented or recognized. The phrase "I just wish it wasn't so **obvious**" indicates a level of irritation or displeasure with the current state of things. It implies that the speaker feels that diversity should exist without drawing significant attention to itself, which could denote a struggle with how diversity is perceived or discussed in society.

Key points to consider:
1. The speaker acknowledges diversity positively, indicating some acceptance.
2. The use of the word "obvious" implies that the speaker finds something in the discussion or presentation of diversity to be excessive or unappealing.
3. The tone suggests a degree of frustration or annoyance rather than outright rejection, which leans more towards anger than other emotions like sadness or disgust.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**.

Response 2:
In analyzing the speaker's comment, several important points can be considered:

1. The speaker claims not to have a problem with diversity, indicating a potential openness to the concept itself, but their use of "obvious" suggests a critique or discomfort with how diversity is being presented or manifested in a given context.

2. The word "obvious" often carries a negative connotation when used in this manner, implying that the speaker finds the emphasis on diversity to be excessive or perhaps inauthentic.

3. While the speaker's statement acknowledges the existence of diversity, their desire for it to not be so "obvious" may indicate an underlying frustration or annoyance at how it is being handled or portrayed.

Given these considerations, the emotion most relevant to the speaker's sentiment appears to align with feelings of displeasure or annoyance, which fall under the category of anger.

Thus, the most relevant emotion label for the speaker's comment is **anger**.

Response 3:
The speaker's comment suggests a mixed sentiment towards diversity. They express a lack of opposition to the concept itself, indicating a neutral stance toward diversity in general. However, the use of the word "obvious" implies a sense of discomfort or annoyance with how diversity is presented or perceived, which could hint at an underlying frustration. The phrasing seems to reflect a desire for a more subtle or less overt expression of diversity. 

Overall, the emotion conveyed leans towards annoyance or frustration with the current state of how diversity is displayed, rather than a flatly negative or hostile feeling.

The most relevant emotion for this comment is **anger**.
