1. The phrase "I tried at a joke" suggests an effort to be humorous, but the use of "tried" implies that the outcome may not have been successful or was received poorly.
2. The speaker doesn't express overt emotion; they are simply stating a fact about their attempt, which leans towards a more neutral presentation.
3. There is no clear indication of anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise in this statement; instead, it feels more like an objective recounting of an action without emotional bias.
