Response 1:
The speaker's comment expresses a physical state ("fully erect") in a context that comes across as contradictory to their feelings towards a subject or group ("I still don't like them"). This suggests a blend of feelings, but the primary emotion here seems to reflect a strong sense of disapproval or distaste towards the subject in question. The phrasing indicates a lack of enthusiasm or positive regard despite a physical state that might typically suggest pleasure or enjoyment. 

Key points to consider:
- The use of "I still don't like them" implies a strong negative feeling.
- The phrase suggests a contradiction between physical arousal and emotional disapproval.
- Overall, the comment does not convey joy, surprise, or a neutral feeling, but rather discontent or aversion.

Based on this analysis, the most relevant emotion label is **disgust**.

Response 2:
In analyzing the speaker's comment, several important points can be considered:

1. **Contradiction in Sentiment**: The speaker is expressing a state of physical arousal ("fully erect") but juxtaposes that with a strong negative sentiment ("still don’t like them"). This highlights an internal conflict between physical response and emotional reaction.

2. **Disapproval Indicated**: The use of "don’t like them" conveys a clear sense of disapproval or dislike towards a person or group, suggesting the speaker feels antagonism.

3. **Informal and Direct Tone**: The casual phrasing, combined with the bluntness of the statement, suggests a raw emotional state, potentially amplifying the feeling of displeasure.

Overall, the speaker is expressing clear discontent despite a physical reaction. This indicates a strong feeling of displeasure or opposition towards the subject mentioned.

Based on these points, the most relevant emotion label for the speaker's sentiment is **anger**.
