In the speaker's comment, there are a few important points to analyze:

1. **Context of the statement**: The phrase "that ain't kosher" suggests a cultural reference, likely to denote that something is against the rules or norms of a specific belief system, in this case, Judaism. This shows a level of awareness about cultural or religious practices.

2. **Implication of exclusion**: The phrase "Hope you're not [RELIGION]" implies a sense of judgment or disapproval toward a specific religious identity. It suggests that being part of a certain religion is undesirable in the context being discussed.

3. **Tone of the comment**: The comment seems to carry a slight mockery or sarcasm, which could imply a condescending attitude toward the beliefs of others, particularly the specified religion.

Considering these points, the emotion that the speaker is most likely expressing is **disgust** due to the judgmental, disapproving nature of the statement, which reflects strong disapproval of a religious practice. 

Thus, the most relevant emotion label for this comment would be **disgust**.
