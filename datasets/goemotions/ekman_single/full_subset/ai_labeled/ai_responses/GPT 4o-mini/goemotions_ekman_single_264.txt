Response 1:
Important points to consider from the text: 

1. The speaker is reflecting on another person's congratulatory comment, indicating a sense of commentary on social interactions.
2. The phrase "Maaan o man" suggests a tone that could be interpreted as incredulous or exasperated, hinting that the speaker may find the situation somewhat ridiculous or ironic.
3. The overall context doesn’t convey overt positivity or negativity, but there is a sense of envy or longing present when wishing for an outcome like the one mentioned.

Given these considerations, the emotion that best captures the speaker's feelings in this context is somewhat lighthearted but tinged with a hint of nostalgia or regret regarding social accomplishments.

**surprise**

Response 2:
In the given text, the speaker expresses a sense of envy or longing as they reflect on someone else's congratulatory comment. The phrase "wishing he could one day get the same" suggests a tone of aspiration rather than outright joy. The repetition of "Maaan o man" can be interpreted as a wistful or exclamatory remark, potentially indicating a mix of admiration and disappointment regarding their own situation in comparison to others.

Important points to consider:
- The speaker's response involves acknowledging another person's achievement, which could indicate respect or admiration.
- However, there is also a sense of yearning or dissatisfaction with one's current status, leading to a feeling that borders between joy for others and sadness for oneself.
- The use of "Maaan o man" suggests a conversational tone that may imply mild exasperation or frustration, reflecting on their own desires in relation to others'.

Considering all these points, the most appropriate emotion label for the speaker’s comment is **sadness**.

Response 3:
In analyzing the speaker's comment, we note a few distinct points:

1. **Tone of Sarcasm or Mockery**: The phrase "Maaan o man" suggests a level of exasperation or a dismissive attitude toward the congratulatory comment, indicating that the speaker does not genuinely commend the commenter's feelings.

2. **Social Commentary**: The speaker appears to be critiquing the social dynamics at play, possibly implying that the congratulator's admiration is misplaced or naïve, which may indicate a negative perception towards the situation.

3. **Lack of Genuine Joy or Humor**: While someone might occasionally express surprise or enthusiasm over a comment from someone significant, the overall tone here veers away from positivity and instead presents a critical viewpoint.

Given these observations, the emotion that seems most fitting for the speaker in this context is one of **disgust** at the perceived frivolity or absurdity of the congratulation.

Therefore, the most relevant emotion label for this comment is **disgust**.
