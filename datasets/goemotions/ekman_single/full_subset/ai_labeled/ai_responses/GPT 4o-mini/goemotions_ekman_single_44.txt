Response 1:
The speaker's comment appears to address a particular issue or misunderstanding related to an ID check that can only be bypassed by an assistant. The tone does not seem to carry strong emotional weight but rather conveys a factual statement or clarification. There is no evident display of displeasure, approval, or any emotional depth that would suggest anger, joy, or sadness. 

The response is primarily informative, indicating a neutral stance without an implication of surprise or any emotional reaction. The focus is on correcting or adding to the conversation rather than expressing feelings regarding the situation.

Response 2:
This comment appears to convey a certain level of critical observation about a procedure that seems to be overlooked by others. The use of "forgot" indicates that the speaker is highlighting an important point that they believe should not have been missed. This suggests they may feel a degree of annoyance or disapproval regarding the omission. However, the comment lacks strong emotional language or expressions of frustration, which would typically signal anger. Instead, it seems to focus more on relaying information and pointing out an oversight in a factual manner.

- The comment reflects a feeling of slight discontent or criticism regarding others' views.
- It does not express strong emotions such as joy, sadness, or surprise.

Considering these points, the most relevant emotion tied to the comment's tone is **neutral**. Therefore, my final response is: **neutral**.
