Response 1:
To analyze the speaker's comment "Australian here. I hereby agree that this does in fact provoke nightmares," we should consider the following important points:

1. The phrase "this does in fact provoke nightmares" suggests a strong negative reaction to whatever is being referenced. This indicates an emotional response that is likely severe enough to cause distress.
2. The use of "provoke nightmares" implies fear or anxiety about the subject at hand. Nightmares are typically associated with unpleasant and scary situations, which could evoke feelings of fear.
3. The comment begins with "Australian here," which is neutral and simply establishes the speaker's identity, but does not add to the emotional context of their statement about nightmares.

Given these points, the strongest emotion conveyed by the speaker is fear, as the comment indicates that they find the topic distressing enough to potentially cause nightmares. 

Thus, the most relevant emotion label is **fear**.

Response 3:
In this comment, the speaker identifies themselves as Australian and expresses agreement with a sentiment that something evokes nightmares. The use of "provokes nightmares" suggests a strong negative response, hinting at fear or distress about the subject being discussed. The phrase "I hereby agree" indicates a level of seriousness in their agreement. 

However, the expression does not convey outright anger or disgust; rather, it reflects a concern for something unsettling that is significant enough to trigger nightmares. The context implies a shared understanding of the fear surrounding it rather than solely an individual's emotion. 

Taking all this into account, the most relevant emotion based on the text is **fear**.
