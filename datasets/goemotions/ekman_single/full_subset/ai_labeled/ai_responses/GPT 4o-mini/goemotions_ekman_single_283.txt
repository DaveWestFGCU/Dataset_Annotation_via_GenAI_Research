Response 1:
In analyzing the speaker's comment, the following points are pertinent:

1. The speaker is responding directly to someone else, indicating there's engagement in a discussion or argument.
2. The use of "plenty" suggests a dismissive tone, implying that the speaker feels the other person has provided sufficient evidence to support a claim, perhaps to the speaker's annoyance.
3. The phrase "proving the original comments point" could imply a sense of adversarial satisfaction, where the speaker feels they have caught the other in a contradiction or mistake.

Given these considerations, the speaker's tone appears to convey irritation or frustration with the context, which aligns closely with feelings of displeasure or disapproval highlighted in the anger category.

Thus, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**.

1. **Dismissiveness**: The speaker seems to dismiss the other person's argument or contribution, indicating a lack of respect or concern for what they have said.

The comment "No that's plenty, you've already proved the original comments point even further" suggests a tone that indicates disagreement and possibly a hint of frustration or annoyance. The use of "proved the original comments point" implies that the speaker feels the other person's response has not only missed the mark but has also reinforced a stance that they find unfavorable or irritating.
