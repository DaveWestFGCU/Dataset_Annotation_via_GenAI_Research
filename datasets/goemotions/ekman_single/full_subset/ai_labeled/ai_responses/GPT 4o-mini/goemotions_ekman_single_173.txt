Response 1:
In analyzing the speaker's comment "Yeah my guess at this point is either a 2 year bridge or 8x8," we can consider the following points:

1. **Speculative Nature**: The speaker seems to be making a prediction or guess about a situation, indicating a level of contemplation or deliberation on their part.
   
2. **Lack of Emotion**: The language used is straightforward and does not contain any overt expressions of strong feelings such as anger, joy, or sadness.
   
3. **Contextual Relevance**: Without additional context, it is difficult to infer deeper emotional undertones, but the phrasing suggests a neutral stance towards whatever situation is being discussed.

Given these points, the speaker's tone and wording suggest a neutral emotional state where they are simply sharing a thought without any significant emotional investment. Therefore, the most relevant emotion label is **neutral**.

Response 2:
Important points to consider from the speaker's comment:
1. The comment is speculative, indicating that the speaker is making a prediction or hypothesis about a situation, likely related to a discussion on a specific topic (e.g., a project, development, or strategy).
2. The use of "my guess" suggests a degree of uncertainty or lack of confidence in the information being discussed.
3. The phrases "2 year bridge" and "8x8" appear technical and are likely jargon relevant to a specific field or community, showcasing the speaker's familiarity with the subject matter.

Given these observations, the speaker does not express strong emotions such as anger, fear, or joy. Instead, their tone seems informational and matter-of-fact, leaning towards a neutral stance in assessing the situation. As such, the most relevant emotion label is **neutral**.

Response 3:
The speaker's comment appears to be speculative in nature, discussing potential outcomes (a "2 year bridge" or "8x8"). The tone is analytical and lacks any strong emotional qualifiers. 

1. The statement does not convey any feeling of strong displeasure or antagonism typically associated with anger. 
2. There is also no indication of revulsionâ€”which would align with disgust. 
3. The mention of estimating potential outcomes does not suggest any fear or anxiety either. 
4. The comment lacks any expressiveness often seen in joyful sentiments and doesn't convey emotional pain associated with sadness.
5. While '8x8' can be a surprise in context, the overall statement is clearly more contextual and deliberate rather than astonished or startled. 
6. Finally, the language used is factual and straightforward without emotional expression, suggesting a neutral stance.

Thus, the most fitting emotion label for this comment is **neutral**.
