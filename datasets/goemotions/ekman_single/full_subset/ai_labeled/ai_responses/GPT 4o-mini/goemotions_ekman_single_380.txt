Response 1:
In this comment, the speaker expresses uncertainty about wanting someone back, which indicates a lack of strong commitment or positive feeling towards that person. The phrase "I agree with [NAME] ONLY if" suggests a conditional agreement, implying that their support is dependent on future performance, which indicates a level of skepticism or hesitation rather than outright negativity. The use of "Idk" (I don't know) also conveys indecision. Overall, the tone is more analytical than emotionally charged, pointing to a neutral stance with some implied concern about future outcomes.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion is **neutral**.
