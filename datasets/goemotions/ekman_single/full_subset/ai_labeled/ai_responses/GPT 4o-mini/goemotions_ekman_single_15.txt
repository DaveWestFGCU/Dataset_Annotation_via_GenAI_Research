Response 2:
In the speaker's comment, they mention receiving "over 900 responses," which indicates a significant level of engagement or interaction with their post. The phrase "it is taking more time than I expected" suggests a degree of frustration or anticipation.

- The mention of hope adds a slightly positive aspect, but it doesn't reach the level of joy.
- The overall tone can be interpreted as neutral, as the speaker is simply providing an update on their situation without any expressively strong feelings.

Given this analysis, the most relevant emotion label for the speaker's comment is **neutral**.
