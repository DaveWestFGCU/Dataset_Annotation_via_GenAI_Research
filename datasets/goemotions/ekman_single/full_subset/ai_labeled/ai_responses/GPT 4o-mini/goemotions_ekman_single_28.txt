Response 1:
In analyzing the speaker's comment, we can discern a couple of critical points:

1. **Frustration with System Abuse**: The phrase "There will *always* someone gaming the system" suggests a sense of irritation regarding individuals who exploit the system. This indicates an underlying displeasure but does not necessarily express outright anger.
  
2. **Altruism and Commitment**: The speaker emphasizes their ongoing commitment to helping those in need, as illustrated by the act of donating food for "the other 999 people that really need assistance." This part of the comment reflects a positive and caring attitude toward those genuinely in need.

3. **Duality of Sentiment**: While there's frustration about system abuse, the predominant feeling conveyed is one of altruism and resolve to continue supporting those who deserve assistance despite the negative behaviors of others.

Considering the mixed emotions present, the dominant sentiment is one of frustration combined with a strong sense of determination to do good. However, given the focus on the discontent regarding the system-gamers, the emotion is closer to anger.

Thus, the most relevant emotion label for the speaker's comment is **anger**.

Response 2:
In this comment, the speaker expresses a recognition of a persistent issue—people taking advantage of systems meant to help others. This acknowledgment comes with a sense of frustration or discontent toward those who manipulate such systems. However, they balance that frustration with a positive action, stating that they continue to donate food to help those in genuine need. This duality suggests a conflicted feeling where disillusionment coexists with a commitment to altruism.

Key points:
1. The phrase "there will *always* someone gaming the system" indicates a strong disapproval of exploitative behavior, hinting at irritation or annoyance.
2. The commitment to donating food for those truly in need reflects a caring attitude, conveying a sense of hopefulness despite frustration with others' actions.

Given this context, the emotion most relevant to the speaker's sentiment is anger, directed at those who exploit the system, tempered by their ongoing desire to help. 

Therefore, the emotion label is **anger**.
