In the provided comment, the speaker appears to express a level of disbelief or astonishment at the lack of negative feedback (downvotes) on the original comment, suggesting an unexpected outcome. The term "omniscum" is likely a derogatory term, indicating contempt toward the subject of the discussion.

3. The tone conveys sarcasm, further highlighting the speaker's astonishment over the situation.
4. The terms used reflect a negative view of the subject, but the main emotion stems from the unexpected nature of the reaction (or lack thereof).

Given these factors, the most relevant emotion is **surprise**.
