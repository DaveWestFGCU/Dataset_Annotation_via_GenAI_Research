Response 2:
The speaker's comment seems to reference a specific quote or scene from the show "The Flash." This suggests a sense of nostalgia or appreciation for the series and its content. The use of "Reminds me of" also indicates a connection to something meaningful or memorable rather than a strong expression of emotion such as anger or sadness.

1. The speaker is likely recalling a line from a show that resonated with them, which implies enjoyment or a positive sentiment.
2. The comment is informal and does not convey negative emotions like anger, disgust, or fear.
3. Since there is no expression of surprise or shock and the comment lacks any emotional distress, it also leans towards being neutral.

Due to the lack of strong emotional retrieval and the casualness of the comment, the final classification would be more aligned with a neutral observation: **neutral**.
