Response 2:
In the provided comment, the speaker expresses a perspective on the dynamics of a situation involving a Dungeon Master (DM) and the gameplay experience. The phrase “just doesn’t really work” suggests a level of disappointment or frustration with the way things are going, potentially hinting at an understanding that cooperative play requires willingness from all parties involved. This might stem from an expectation not being met or an acknowledgment of a lack of engagement. However, the tone is relatively measured and lacks overt emotional intensity.

1. The speaker seems to be addressing a limitation, which could imply mild frustration but isn't explicit anger.
2. The comment lacks strong negative feelings (disgust) or fear, as it does not convey distress or worry.
3. There's no sense of joy or excitement present, nor is there a profound sadness expressed.
4. There might be an undercurrent of surprise at the situation, but it doesn’t manifest as astonishment or disbelief.

Considering the overall sentiment and tone of the comment, it most closely aligns with a neutral emotional expression, as it presents a straightforward observation without heavy emotional engagement.

**neutral**

Response 3:
In this comment, the speaker seems to express a sense of resignation or acceptance about a situation that is not ideal. The mention of "doesn't really work" suggests an acknowledgment of a limitation or a barrier to a more favorable outcome, particularly in the context of collaboration or gaming (likely referring to a Dungeon Master in a game context). The phrase "if the DM doesn't want it to" implies that the speaker feels constrained by another person's decisions or preferences, suggesting a lack of power or agency.

Key points to consider:
- The speaker indicates that the effectiveness of a situation hinges on the will of another person (the DM).
- There is a sense of inevitability or acceptance of circumstances beyond the speaker's control.
- This comment does not convey any strong positive or negative emotion but seems more observational in nature.

Given these points, the most relevant emotion for this comment is neutral, as it lacks strong emotional expression. 

**neutral**
