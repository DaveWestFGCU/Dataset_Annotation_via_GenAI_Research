Response 2:
In this comment, the speaker expresses curiosity about the potential actions of an unspecified group of people (presumably those opposing a political stance) and uses a teasing or ironic tone with the phrase "own the ~~libs~~." The phrasing suggests an underlying skepticism or critical view of the motivations behind the action of upvoting. The use of "curious though" indicates that the speaker is pondering an interesting scenario rather than expressing a strong emotion.

Important points to consider:
1. The word "curious" indicates a sense of intrigue rather than strong feelings like anger or joy.
2. The context hints at political discourse, which could invoke various emotions, but the tone remains light and observational rather than hostile.
3. The use of light sarcasm with "own the ~~libs~~" implies an awareness of social dynamics without heated emotions.

Given these observations, the most relevant emotion conveyed by the speaker is neutral, as they are expressing curiosity without a strong emotional investment.

**neutral**

Response 3:
In this Reddit comment, the speaker expresses curiosity about whether others will upvote something, but it carries a sarcastic tone directed toward a specific group (referred to as "libs"). The use of "own" suggests a competitive or antagonistic relationship with that group, implying a sense of mockery or insincerity. This framing indicates a mixture of skepticism and potential disdain towards the group's motivations, hinting at a negative emotional stance. 

It's important to consider:
- The sarcastic tone implies a critical viewpoint.
- The phrase suggests a rivalry or disagreement, likely leading to feelings of displeasure or antagonism.
- The overall context hints that there is an expectation of negative behavior from the group mentioned.

These points align the speaker's sentiment more closely with feelings of anger towards the perceived intentions of the "libs."

Thus, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**.
