Response 1:
In this comment, the speaker expresses a dismissive sentiment towards the duration of a relationship mentioned by another. The use of "Psh" indicates a level of skepticism or disbelief, which can be seen as a form of annoyance. The speaker reflects on their own long-term commitment, which suggests a contrast with the other person's situation. Here are important points to consider:

- The speaker's tone is sarcastic, showing that they may find the other person's experience trivial compared to their own.
- There is an element of superiority in the way the speaker presents their own long-term relationship, suggesting a feeling of frustration with the perceived shorter duration of the other person's commitment.
- The comment does not convey any positive sentiment but rather dismissive or belittling feelings.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion here is **anger**.

Response 2:
The speaker’s comment reflects a sense of incredulity or dismissal towards the time frame mentioned in the original context. The "Psh" conveys a casual disdain or disbelief regarding the duration being referred to, which suggests a lack of respect for it. This implies that the speaker may feel superior or that the situation presented is trivial in comparison to their own experience. 

Key points to consider:
- The use of "Psh" indicates a dismissive tone.
- Comparing their own long relationship to the shorter duration mentioned suggests a sense of pride or superiority.
- The overall sentiment leans towards annoyance rather than straightforward anger.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label for the speaker’s sentiment is **anger**.

Response 3:
In this comment, the speaker expresses a sense of disbelief or dismissal regarding the duration of another person's relationship compared to their own. The use of "Psh" suggests a light mocking or condescending tone, indicating that they find the other person's timeframe trivial or insufficient. This could imply a sense of superiority or a lack of respect for the situation being discussed. The speaker's reference to their own long engagement suggests pride in their commitment, but it is also framed in a way that diminishes the value of the other person's experience.

Given these points, the emotion most relevant to the speaker's comment reflects a tone of incredulity and judgment, more aligned with **disgust** for how they perceive the other person's relationship duration.

**disgust**
