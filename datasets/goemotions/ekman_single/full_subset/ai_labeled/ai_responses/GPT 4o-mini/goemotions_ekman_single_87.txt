Response 1:
When analyzing the phrase "but time is meaningless," several points can be considered:

1. **Context Dependence**: The interpretation of this statement largely depends on the context in which it was made. Without additional information or surrounding discussion, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact feeling behind the comment.
   
2. **Philosophical Undertones**: The phrase suggests a potentially existential or philosophical viewpoint, indicating a detachment or contemplation about the nature of time. This might come from a place of introspection rather than a strong emotional reaction.

3. **Emotion Interpretation**: 
   - It does not convey anger or disgust since it lacks negative emotional language.
   - There is no clear indication of fear in the statement.
   - There is no expression of joy or excitement present.
   - The statement can evoke a sense of sadness, but it does not explicitly express emotional pain or sorrow.
   - It also doesn't suggest surprise, as it appears to be a straightforward assertion.

4. **Neutral Tone**: Given the lack of strong emotion and the philosophical nature of the statement, it leans towards a neutral observation or perspective on time.

In the comment "but time is meaningless," several points can be considered to identify the speaker's emotion:

1. **Contextual Ambiguity**: The statement is somewhat abstract and lacks specifics, making it difficult to deduce a strong emotional state. The phrase suggests a philosophical or possibly nihilistic viewpoint rather than an emotionally charged statement.

2. **Emotional Tone**: The use of the word "meaningless" can imply a sense of futility or disillusionment, which can be associated with sadness or a neutral observation—depending on the larger context in which this statement was made.
