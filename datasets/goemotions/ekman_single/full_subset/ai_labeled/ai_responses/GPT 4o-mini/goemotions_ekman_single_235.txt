Response 1:
The speaker expresses a sense of appreciation for the effort or commitment shown, indicated by their use of "I appreciate the dedication." However, this appreciation is juxtaposed with a critical observation regarding the silence maintained for "three quarters of the game," suggesting a level of disappointment or disapproval regarding that aspect of the situation.

Key points to consider:
- There is an acknowledgment of effort, which reflects a positive sentiment.
- The criticism implies a level of dissatisfaction or annoyance with the silence, indicating a conflict in feelings.

Given these elements, the emotion that best aligns with the speaker's overall sentiment, merging appreciation with a hint of disappointment or annoyance, is most consistent with **anger**. This expression shows displeasure towards the decision to remain silent, despite recognizing the dedication involved. 

Thus, the most relevant emotion label is **anger**.

Response 3:
In the speaker's comment, they express appreciation for dedication but also imply a level of discontent or disappointment regarding the silence during a significant part of the game. The phrase "really didn't have to be silent" suggests an expectation that was not met, indicating a nuanced feeling rather than outright negativity.

- The speaker acknowledges and appreciates the effort, which indicates a positive aspect of their emotion.
- However, the disappointment in the performance (being silent for three quarters) reflects a degree of dissatisfaction.

Considering these points, the sentiment does not align strongly with anger, disgust, fear, or joy overall. Instead, it has elements of disappointment which is often associated with sadness.

Thus, the most relevant emotion label is **sadness**.

Response 4:
In this comment, the speaker acknowledges the effort or commitment of another party but simultaneously expresses a level of disappointment regarding their behavior during a game. The use of "really didn't have to be silent" suggests a critical stance towards the silence, which implies a feeling of frustration or annoyance.

Important points to consider:
- There is an acknowledgment ("I appreciate the dedication") indicating a potential for positive regard.
- The main thrust of the comment is critical, focusing on the negative experience of silence during the game.
- The juxtaposition of appreciation with a criticism suggests an undercurrent of irritation.

Taking these factors into account, the most relevant emotion here is frustration or irritation, which falls under the broader category of **anger**. Therefore, the emotion label is **anger**.
