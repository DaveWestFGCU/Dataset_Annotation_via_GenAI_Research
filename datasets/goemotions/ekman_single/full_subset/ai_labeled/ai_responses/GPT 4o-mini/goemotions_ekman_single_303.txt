Response 1:
In this comment, the speaker appears to express a sarcastic tone when they mention "5 downvotes in 3 minutes." The use of "Wow" suggests an element of astonishment, but it likely carries a hint of irony or mockery given the context of downvotes, which usually indicate disapproval or negativity.

Key points to consider:
- The phrase "Go you!" implies a sense of sarcasm directed at the person being commented on, as it typically would be seen as praising someone's effort but is juxtaposed with the context of downvotes.
- The surprise element comes from the quick accumulation of downvotes, which is often unexpected and can elicit an amazed response, though it’s tinged with negativity.
- The speaker's overall demeanor leans towards disbelief or irony rather than genuine joy or positivity.

Given these considerations, the most relevant emotion label is **surprise**.
