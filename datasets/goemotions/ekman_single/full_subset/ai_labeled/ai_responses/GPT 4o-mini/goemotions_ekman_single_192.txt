Response 1:
In the provided Reddit comment, the speaker expresses a sentiment that implies disapproval or a strong negative reaction regarding the actions of someone else which they associate with shame. This reflects a sense of moral or personal disapproval concerning the topic at hand.

Important points to consider:
1. The phrase "ashamed to have him do that" indicates a strong negative feeling tied to the action or behavior in question.
2. There is a lack of empathy or approval, suggesting displeasure or a judgment on the actions related to that person.
3. The speaker uses “even if” to underscore a hypothetical situation where they still wouldn’t approve, demonstrating a firm stance against the behavior.

Based on these observations, the most relevant emotion label is **disgust**.
