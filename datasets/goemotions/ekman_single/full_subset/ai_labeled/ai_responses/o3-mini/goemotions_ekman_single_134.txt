Response 1:
Important points to consider:
• The phrase is brief, in all caps, and seems to reference a pop culture figure (Admiral Ackbar), which is typically used by fans in a humorous or enthusiastic manner.
• Rather than conveying displeasure, sorrow, or fear, the comment appears to celebrate or pay tribute in a meme-like, energetic way.
• There is no strong evidence of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise.

Thus, the most relevant emotion is **joy**.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:
• The phrase "AND KEEP ACKBAR" is a reference, likely nodding to the Star Wars meme culture, which doesn't explicitly express strong positive or negative feelings.
• The comment is written in all caps, which can sometimes indicate emphasis or enthusiasm, but on its own, it doesn't affirm a clear emotion like anger, joy, or fear.
• The statement functions more as a humorous nod or rallying cry rather than an expression of a deep emotional state.

**neutral**
