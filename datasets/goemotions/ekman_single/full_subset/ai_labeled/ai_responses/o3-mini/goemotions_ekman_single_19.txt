Response 2:
Important Points:
• The comment juxtaposes an observation about a person’s ice cream preference with a surprising reaction to the sight of a kitchen sink.
• The phrase “makes me want to drive home” implies a strong repulsive or dismissive reaction, rather than mere indifference or amusement.
• This negative reaction fits the definition of disgust, which includes revulsion toward something perceived as unpleasant.

**disgust**

Response 3:
Important points to consider:
• The speaker first makes an observation ("This South Florida girl loves Jaxons Ice Cream.") which seems casual.
• The second part ("Seeing the kitchen sink makes me want to drive home.") suggests a reaction to something that triggers a strong aversive response, implying the speaker finds it off-putting or unpleasant.
• The reaction of wanting to leave (drive home) when confronted with the "kitchen sink" indicates a sense of repulsion.
  
Thus, the emotion most conveyed is **disgust**.
