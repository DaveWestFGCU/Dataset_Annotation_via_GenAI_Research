Response 3:
Important points to consider:
• The speaker is using the word “amazed” to emphasize disbelief at the result.
• The unexpected low outcome (only 2 points) strengthens the sense of astonishment.
• Although there is clear disapproval (calling it “one of the worst periods I’ve watched”), the emotion most evident in the wording is one of being startled or taken aback.
