Response 1:
Important points to consider:
• The comment states an observation about the video being used entirely and without editing.
• The phrase "that’s copyright" is presented as a factual remark rather than a strong emotional outburst.
• There is no overt expression of displeasure, revulsion, fear, or sadness—just a straightforward note about a copyright issue.

Thus, the speaker’s emotion comes across as **neutral**.
