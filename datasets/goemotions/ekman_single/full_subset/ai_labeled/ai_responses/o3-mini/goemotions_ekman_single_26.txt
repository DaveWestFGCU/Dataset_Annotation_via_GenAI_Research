Response 2:
Important points to consider:
• The speaker’s comment is matter-of-fact and blends a recognized pattern of capitalism with a somewhat resigned acknowledgement of impending economic downturn.
• Phrases like “That's capitalism for you” and “don’t worry though” indicate an awareness of the cyclical, perhaps ironic nature of economic fluctuations, without overt emotional intensity or alarm.
• Although referencing “another recession” might normally evoke worry, the overall tone remains detached and observational.
