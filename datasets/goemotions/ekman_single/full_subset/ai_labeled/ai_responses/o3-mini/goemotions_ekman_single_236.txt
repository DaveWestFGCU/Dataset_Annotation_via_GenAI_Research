Response 1:
Important points to consider:
• The speaker starts positively—“I like this”—indicating approval.
• They then criticize that the portrayal doesn’t capture the intended horror (“horrifying rotting smell”), which suggests a playful yet critical tone.
• The remark “It sounds sort of cute! She was not lol” adds humor and levity to the comment.

The overall tone is playful and amused despite the critique, so the most relevant emotion is **joy**.
