Response 1:
Important points to consider:
• The sentence "Oh. Well then." is very short and lacks strong expressive language.
• It doesn’t include explicit expressions of anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.
• The phrase appears to be a minimal, perhaps even dismissive, response without a clear emotional charge.

**neutral**

Response 2:
Important points to consider:
- The comment is very brief and lacks context, making it difficult to identify strong emotional cues.
- The use of "Oh. Well then." suggests a simple acknowledgment or transition without expressing overt emotion.
- There are no indications of anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:
• The text is very minimal with only two short interjections ("Oh." and "Well then."), which might suggest a mild realization or resignation, but not an overtly strong emotion.
• There is no clear expression of joy, anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise; the language remains quite sparse and doesn't provide strong emotional cues.
