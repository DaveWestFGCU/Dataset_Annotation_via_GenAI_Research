Response 1:
Important points to consider:
• The speaker makes an observational statement that implies they prefer to ignore what is directly in front of them to avoid dealing with it.
• There is a sense of willful inattention, but no strong emotion (like anger, fear, or joy) is explicitly expressed.
• The statement is more descriptive and reflective of a strategy rather than conveying an overt emotional reaction.

**neutral**

Response 2:
Important points: 
• The speaker uses avoidance as a way to cope by not looking at something that may be distressing.
• This suggests a desire to avoid an unpleasant or anxiety‐inducing situation.
• This aligns with the definition of fear, where avoidance is driven by worry or nervousness.
