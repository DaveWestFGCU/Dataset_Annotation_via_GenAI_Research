• The comment is brief and consists of an exclamation ("Oh, a crow...") followed by a self-directed exclamation ("Doh!").
• The exclamations suggest a sudden realization or mild mistake rather than a deep feeling of anger or sadness.
• The use of "Doh!" (popularized by Homer Simpson) commonly indicates a moment of realizing one’s error in a light-hearted way.

Based on these observations, the most relevant emotion is **surprise**.
