Response 3:
The comment appears to convey a sense of disappointment or criticism regarding someone’s actions during a hearing. The phrase "It blew up in her" suggests that the person’s attempt to engage in a game or tactic backfired, indicating a negative outcome. The tone seems to imply a judgment about this behavior, hinting at disapproval or a sense of moral high ground without expressing strong anger or disgust. Overall, it has an undertone of bemused disapproval, but primarily reflects dissatisfaction.

Hence, the emotion most expressed by the writer is related to disapproval and disappointment rather than outright anger or disgust, so it can be characterized as neutral because it lacks strong emotional depth.

**neutral**
