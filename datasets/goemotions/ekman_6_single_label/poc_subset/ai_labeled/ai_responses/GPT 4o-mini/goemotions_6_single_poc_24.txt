Response 2:
The writer of the text appears to be questioning the relevance or significance of someone stating their affiliation with "/r/All." This could suggest a sense of annoyance or disapproval of the other person's comment or stance, implying that they find the statement unnecessary or unimportant. The tone seems to reflect a lack of understanding or patience with the focus on the subreddit affiliation rather than the content of the discussion.

Thus, the most expressed emotion in this text is likely to be frustration or annoyance, which aligns best with the category of anger.

**anger**

Response 3:
In the provided Reddit comment, the writer expresses a tone that suggests confusion or a lack of understanding about the significance of the information shared by the other person.
