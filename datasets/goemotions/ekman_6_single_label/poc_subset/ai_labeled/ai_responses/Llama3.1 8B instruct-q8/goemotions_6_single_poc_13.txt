* The writer is providing a statement about "The Birds" without expressing any strong emotions or personal opinions.
* There is no language used that indicates enthusiasm, excitement, or approval (which would be associated with joy).
* The tone of the comment is informative and matter-of-fact, rather than negative or critical (which might suggest anger or disgust).
