Response 1:
To identify the emotion expressed by the writer of the text, let's consider the following points:

* The writer uses a questioning tone, indicating that they are seeking clarification or justification.
* The phrase "Sorry" is used as a polite expression, but it doesn't necessarily convey genuine apology or remorse.
* The emphasis is on why something should matter, implying a sense of puzzlement or annoyance.

Given these points, I would label the emotion expressed by the writer as **neutral**, with a hint of underlying annoyance. However, upon closer examination, I realize that the tone is more questioning and inquiring than explicitly annoyed. Therefore, I will revise my answer to reflect this nuance.

Since "neutral" implies a lack of strong emotions, but the writer's tone is still somewhat inquisitive and mildly disapproving, I would choose **neutral** as the most fitting label for this comment.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The writer is responding to someone's claim or statement.
* They seem skeptical and questioning the relevance of the information.
* Their tone appears dismissive, as indicated by the phrase "Sorry but".

Given these points, the emotion expressed by the writer is a sense of skepticism and dismissal, which aligns with **anger**.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the comment is questioning and slightly dismissive.
* The phrase "Sorry but" is a polite way of expressing disagreement or surprise, rather than genuine apology.
* The question itself implies that the commenter finds the information about being from r/All irrelevant or unnecessary.

Given these points, I would label this emotion as:

**disgust**

Reasoning: While the tone is not overtly angry or confrontational, it has a slightly dismissive and possibly annoyed undertone. The phrase "Sorry but" suggests that the commenter is surprised or disapproving of the information being shared. This aligns with the definition of disgust as revulsion or strong disapproval aroused by something unpleasant or offensive.
