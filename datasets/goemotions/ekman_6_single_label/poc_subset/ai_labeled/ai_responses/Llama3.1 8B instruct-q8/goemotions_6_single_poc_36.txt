Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The writer is expressing a negative opinion, but not explicitly stating what they are dissatisfied with.
* The language used is brief and dismissive ("dumber here").
* There is no indication of emotional intensity or personal stake.

Given these considerations, I would label the emotion as **anger**.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The writer is comparing two individuals as being equally foolish or stupid.
* The tone is blunt and matter-of-fact, with a hint of incredulity.
* There is no evident enthusiasm, excitement, or warmth in the language used.

**anger**

The emotion most expressed by the writer is anger because the tone is confrontational and critical, implying a strong sense of disapproval or frustration towards both individuals being compared. The use of the word "dumber" also suggests a negative emotional tone.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The writer of the text expresses a strong negative sentiment towards two individuals or groups (implied by the phrase "who is dumber").
* The tone of the sentence is blunt and dismissive, indicating a lack of regard for one or both parties.
* There is no indication of fear, disgust, joy, sadness, surprise, or neutrality in the writer's language.

Based on these points, I conclude that the emotion most expressed by the writer of the text is:

**anger**

The writer's strong negative sentiment and dismissive tone are characteristic of anger. The phrase "I don't know who is dumber" implies a sense of frustration or annoyance, further supporting this conclusion.
