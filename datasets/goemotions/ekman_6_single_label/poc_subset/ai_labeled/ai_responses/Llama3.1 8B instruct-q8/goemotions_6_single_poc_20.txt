Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The text appears to be a brief and somewhat cryptic response.
* The tone is calm and matter-of-fact, with no obvious emotional language or punctuation (e.g., exclamation marks).
* There are no negative or positive adjectives or emotive words used in the comment.
