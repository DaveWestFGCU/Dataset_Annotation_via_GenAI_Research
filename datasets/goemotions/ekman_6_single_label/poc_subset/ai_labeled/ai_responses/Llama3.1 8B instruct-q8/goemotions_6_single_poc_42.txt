Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the comment is informal and lighthearted, with a dash of sarcasm.
* The language used is colloquial ("lol...") which suggests a casual, joking tone.
* The phrase "Bears are empathetic creatures?" is phrased as a question, but the addition of "lol..." implies that it's not meant to be taken seriously.

Given these points, I would say that the writer is expressing **surprise**, albeit in a tongue-in-cheek way. The surprise is not at being shocked or alarmed by the idea, but rather at the absurdity of the claim and the humor in presenting it as a serious proposition.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the comment is lighthearted and playful, indicated by the use of "lol" at the end.
* The language used suggests a sense of amusement or mockery towards the idea that bears are empathetic.
* There is no apparent anger, fear, sadness, or disgust in the comment.

Given these points, I would label the emotion as: **amusement** (However, since amusement is not one of the options provided and is close to "joy", I will select)

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The writer of the text uses a casual and ironic tone, with a hint of skepticism.
* They use a colloquial expression ("lol...") that suggests a lighthearted or playful attitude.
* The statement about bears being empathetic creatures is presented as an unexpected or humorous claim.

Given these points, I would label the emotion expressed by the writer as:

**surprise**
 
However, considering the tone and language used, it's also possible to interpret the writer's response as slightly sarcastic or mocking, which could be more accurately labeled as **disgust**. But based on the provided examples and definitions, I lean towards **surprise**, as it seems to be a more fitting match for the lighthearted and ironic tone of the comment.
