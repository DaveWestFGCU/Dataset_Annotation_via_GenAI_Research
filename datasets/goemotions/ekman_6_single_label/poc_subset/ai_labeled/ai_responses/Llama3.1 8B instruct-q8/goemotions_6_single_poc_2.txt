Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The comment appears to be a statement of anticipation or expectation about someone's fate.
* The tone seems matter-of-fact and lacks emotional embellishment.

Given these considerations, the emotion most expressed by the writer is **neutral**. The comment does not convey any strong emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise, but rather presents a neutral statement of fact.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The writer seems to be expecting a negative outcome for the person mentioned.
* There is no indication of excitement, happiness, or positivity in the statement.
* The tone appears to be matter-of-fact and somewhat pessimistic.

Given these points, I would label the emotion expressed by the writer as **sadness**.
