Important points to consider:

* The tone of the comment appears to be sarcastic and tongue-in-cheek.
* The commenter seems to be amused or entertained by the idea of someone watching them use the bathroom, but is also warning them that they will have to deal with the consequences (i.e. cleaning up after themselves).
* There is no apparent anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise expressed in the comment.

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The tone of the comment is casual and instructive.
* The speaker appears to be offering advice to someone on how to handle a situation with a potential toilet cleaner, specifically suggesting that they should be prepared for the consequences of not cleaning up after themselves.
* There is no apparent emotional intensity or personal investment in the issue being discussed.

Based on these points, I would label the emotion expressed by the writer as **neutral**. The tone is informative and matter-of-fact, without any strong emotions or biases.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The writer is offering advice to someone about how to deal with a messy situation.
* The tone of the comment is matter-of-fact and includes a hint of warning or preparation for a potentially unpleasant outcome.
* The language used is not aggressive or confrontational, but rather practical and helpful.

Given these points, I would categorize the emotion expressed in this text as **neutral**. The writer's tone is neutral and lacking in emotional expression, focusing on providing advice rather than expressing a strong feeling about the situation.
