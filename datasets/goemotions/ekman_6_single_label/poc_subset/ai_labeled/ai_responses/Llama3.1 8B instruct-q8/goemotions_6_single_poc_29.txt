Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The writer seems uncertain and questioning about something related to the person they are addressing.
* They express a lack of knowledge or understanding, using phrases like "I honestly don't know".
* There is no apparent emotional tone of anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise.

Given these observations, I label the emotion as **neutral**, as the writer's statement lacks an expressed emotional tone and instead conveys a sense of uncertainty and inquiry.
