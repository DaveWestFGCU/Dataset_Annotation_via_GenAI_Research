To determine the emotion expressed by the writer of the text, we can consider the following points:

* The tone of the comment is cautionary and advisory.
* The writer is expressing a warning or preparation for potential consequences.
* There is no overt expression of pleasure, happiness, or excitement.

Given these considerations, the writer's primary concern seems to be anticipating negative outcomes. This aligns with a sense of emotional pain or worry about potential repercussions.
