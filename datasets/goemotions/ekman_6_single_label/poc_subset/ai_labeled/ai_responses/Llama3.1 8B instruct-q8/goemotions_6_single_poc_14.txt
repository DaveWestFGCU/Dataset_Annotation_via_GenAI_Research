Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The writer is directly addressing someone else's statement as a lie.
* They are using a confrontational tone by saying "Now you're lying".
* Their response is focused on correcting the other person's assertion.

Given these points, the emotion expressed by the writer is anger. 

**anger**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response 2:
Important points to consider:

* The writer uses a direct accusation ("Now you're lying") which suggests a strong negative emotion.
* The tone of the sentence is confrontational, with an implication that the person being addressed has made a false statement.
* The writer explicitly states that suburbs are superior to specific cities (Bellevue and Kirkland), implying a sense of disapproval or annoyance.

Based on these points, I would categorize the emotion expressed by the writer as:

**anger**

Note: This response assumes that the tone of the sentence is primarily one of anger or frustration, rather than a genuine attempt at objective comparison. The use of "Now you're lying" suggests a high level of emotional intensity and a sense of righteous indignation, which are characteristic of anger.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The writer accuses someone of lying.
* They express a strong comparison between suburbs and specific locations (Bellevue and Kirkland).
* The tone is confrontational.

Given these considerations, the emotion most expressed by the writer is **anger**. The accusation of lying and the confrontational tone suggest that the writer feels strongly displeased or antagonistic towards the person they are responding to.
