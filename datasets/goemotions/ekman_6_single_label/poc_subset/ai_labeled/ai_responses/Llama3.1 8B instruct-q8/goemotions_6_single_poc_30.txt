Response 1:
Important points to consider:

* The commenter uses the word "insane", which can imply a strong emotional response.
* The tone of the comment seems to be one of astonishment or shock.

Based on these considerations, I would label the emotion as **surprise**. The commenter's use of the word "Wow" and the phrase "that was insane" suggests that they are expressing surprise at something unexpected.

Response 3:
Important points to consider:

* The writer's tone is brief and informal.
* They express a strong emotional reaction using the word "insane".
* Their language does not convey any negative or positive connotation.

Given these considerations, I would label the emotion expressed by the writer as:

**surprise**

The use of the word "insane" suggests that the writer is astonished or startled by something they witnessed, which aligns with the definition of surprise. The tone and language do not suggest a strong negative emotional response (anger), disgust, fear, or sadness, nor a positive emotional response (joy). Additionally, there's no indication of neutrality.
