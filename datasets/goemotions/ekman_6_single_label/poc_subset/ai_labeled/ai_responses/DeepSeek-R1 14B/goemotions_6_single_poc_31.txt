Alright, so I need to figure out which emotion is most expressed in this Reddit comment: "The internationalist EU. The [NAME], [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] are just brimming with all that international SOLIDARITY ❤️". 

First, let me break down the text. The writer starts by mentioning the European Union as an internationalist entity, which suggests they're talking about unity or cooperation among nations. Then they list several names (probably countries) and use words like "brimming" and "solidarity," which are positive terms indicating support and togetherness.

The inclusion of a heart emoji ❤️ is a clear indicator of affection or positive sentiment. The word "international solidarity" also conveys a sense of unity and approval, suggesting the writer feels positively about it.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger would involve frustration or dislike, which isn't present here. Disgust involves revulsion, but again, that's not there. Fear is about being afraid or worried, which doesn't fit either. Joy includes happiness, approval, and positive feelings, which aligns with the comment. Sadness involves sorrow or disappointment, not applicable here. Surprise is about astonishment, which isn't evident.

The heart emoji strengthens the case for joy because it's often used to express love or affection, which are part of the joy category as per the definitions given. 

So, putting it all together, the emotion most expressed here is joy.

Alright, so I need to figure out which emotion is most expressed in this Reddit comment: "The internationalist EU. The [NAME], [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] are just brimming with all that international SOLIDARITY ❤️". 

First, let me read the comment carefully. It starts by mentioning the European Union as an internationalist organization, then lists some names which I assume are countries or entities within the EU. The key part is "brimming with all that international SOLIDARITY" followed by a heart emoji.

The emotion categories to choose from are anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and neutral. 

Looking at the definitions:

- Joy includes feelings like happiness, pleasure, approval, etc., and often involves positive expressions or sentiments towards others.
- The comment is talking about solidarity, which implies unity and support among nations. The heart emoji adds an affectionate touch, suggesting a positive emotion.

I don't see any signs of anger (displeasure), disgust (revulsion), fear (worry), sadness (sorrow), surprise (astonishment), or neutrality here. Instead, the language used—solidarity and the heart emoji—clearly convey a sense of approval and happiness.

So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed is joy.

The comment expresses **joy** because it highlights unity and support with positive sentiment and an affectionate emoji.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out which emotion is most expressed in this Reddit comment: "The internationalist EU. The [NAME], [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] are just brimming with all that international SOLIDARITY ❤️". 

First, I'll read through the comment carefully. It starts by mentioning the European Union as an internationalist entity, which is positive because it's about unity among countries. Then it lists several names, probably of member states, and says they're "brimming" with solidarity, ending with a heart emoji.

Looking at the emotion categories, I need to match this sentiment. The words used are all positive—solidarity implies agreement and support. The heart emoji reinforces a positive or approving feeling. 

Let's consider each emotion:

- **Anger**: Doesn't seem present; no signs of displeasure or antagonism.
- **Disgust**: No indication of revulsion or disapproval.
- **Fear**: There's no sense of worry or anxiety here.
- **Joy**: Fits because solidarity and the heart emoji indicate happiness, approval, and positive feelings. The tone is upbeat and approving.
- **Sadness**: No sorrow or disappointment expressed.
- **Surprise**: The comment doesn't present anything unexpected.
- **Neutral**: Definitely not neutral; there's a clear positive emotion.

So, the most fitting emotion here is joy because it expresses approval, positivity, and a sense of community spirit through solidarity. The heart emoji also supports this as an expression of affection or agreement.
