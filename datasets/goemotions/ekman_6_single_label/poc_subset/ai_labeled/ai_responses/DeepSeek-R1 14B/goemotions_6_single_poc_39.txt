Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion expressed in this Reddit comment: "I skipped the Oilers game for a birthday party for a cat. I'm glad I did that instead." Let me break it down.

First, looking at the structure of the sentence. The person is sharing an action they took—skipping an Oilers game—and then expressing their feelings about it. They say they're "glad" they did that. 

The word "glad" immediately makes me think of joy because it's a positive emotion showing satisfaction or happiness with the decision made. But I should consider other possibilities too.

Looking at the context: skipping a hockey game for a cat's birthday party. That might seem unusual, but the person is happy about their choice. There's no indication of anger, disgust, fear, surprise, sadness, or neutrality here.

Emotion definitions:
- Joy includes happiness, satisfaction, so "glad" fits.
- Other emotions don't match; there's no strong feeling like anger, no revulsion (disgust), no fear or anxiety, no surprise, and definitely not neutral because they're expressing a clear emotion.

So yeah, the emotion here is joy. The person is happy with their decision to attend the cat's party instead of the game.

The emotion expressed in the comment is **joy**.

Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion expressed in this Reddit comment: "I skipped the Oilers game for a birthday party for a cat. I'm glad I did that instead." Alright, let's break it down.

First, looking at the structure of the sentence. The person mentions skipping an event (Oilers game) to attend another event—a birthday party for a cat. That's already a bit unusual because people don't usually throw birthday parties for cats unless they're really into their pets or it's a special case.

Then, in the second part, the person says, "I'm glad I did that instead." The use of "glad" here indicates positive feelings about their decision. So, expressing satisfaction or happiness with choosing the cat's party over the Oilers game.

Now, considering the emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, neutral.

Anger doesn't seem to fit because there's no indication of frustration or displeasure. Disgust is also out since nothing offensive or unpleasant is mentioned. Fear isn't present either; there's no worry or anxiety expressed. Sadness is unlikely as the person expresses satisfaction instead of sorrow. Surprise might come into play if attending a cat's birthday was unexpected, but the emotion here seems more positive than astonishment.

That leaves joy and neutral. Joy fits because "glad" conveys happiness or pleasure. Neutral isn't appropriate since an emotion is clearly expressed—positive at that.

So, putting it all together, the emotion is joy.

The comment expresses satisfaction with choosing a cat's birthday party over a hockey game, using "glad," which indicates happiness. 

**joy**
