Alright, I'm trying to figure out the emotion expressed in this Reddit comment: "Thank u!!! Im gonna try this one bless u". Let me break it down step by step.

First, I notice that the writer is using a lot of exclamation marks. That usually indicates strong positive emotions. They're thanking someone and expressing gratitude, which makes me think of joy or happiness. The words "thank u" are pretty straightforward and commonly used when someone is happy or appreciative.

Looking at the emotion definitions, joy includes feelings like gratitude and pleasure. The writer's use of "bless u" also adds to that positive vibe, showing they're wishing well on the other person. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger or disgust. No fear or surprise is evident either; it's all about expressing thanks and a willingness to try something, which sounds excited.

I don't see any elements of sadness or neutral feelings here. The tone is upbeat and enthusiastic. So putting it all together, the emotion here is definitely joy.

Alright, let's figure out the emotion expressed in the comment: "Thank u!!! Im gonna try this one bless u". 

First, I'll break down the words. The user starts with "Thank u!!!" which is a strong expression of gratitude. Using three exclamation points shows excitement and enthusiasm. Then they say "Im gonna try this one" indicating willingness and positivity towards something. Finally, "bless u" adds another layer of appreciation or maybe even affection.

Looking at the emotion categories: anger doesn't fit because there's no frustration or irritation here. Disgust is out since there's nothing offensive mentioned. Fear isn't present either; the tone is positive. Joy seems to align with the gratitude and excitement. Sadness, surprise, and neutral don't match the upbeat and thankful mood.

So, putting it all together, the emotion is clearly joy.
